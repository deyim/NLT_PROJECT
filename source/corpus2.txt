Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder-Decoder for Statistical Machine Translation
.

In this paper, we propose a novel neural network model called RNN Encoder-Decoder that consists of two recurrent neural networks (RNN). One RNN encodes a sequence of symbols into a fixed-length vector representation, and the other decodes the representation into another sequence of symbols. The encoder and decoder of the proposed model are jointly trained to maximize the conditional probability of a target sequence given a source sequence. The performance of a statistical machine translation system is empirically found to improve by using the conditional probabilities of phrase pairs computed by the RNN Encoder-Decoder as an additional feature in the existing log-linear model. Qualitatively, we show that the proposed model learns a semantically and syntactically meaningful representation of linguistic phrases. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Master Data Management (MDM) is an approach for effective management of shared master data across organizations. In the public sector, MDM initiatives have been developed; however, the adoption among local government remains slow and there has been little interest in MDM adoption in extant research. Building on a Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework, a conceptual model which highlights a set of potential determinants affecting the adoption of MDM by local government was developed. To validate the model, data were collected via survey from 224 responses from Malaysian local government department units. Using SEM-PLS, the study confirmed that data quality and data governance are two determinants of MDM adoption specific to the context of Malaysian local government, and four other determinants – complexity, top management support, technological competence, and citizen demand – are found to have significant effects on MDM adoption by local government. Surprisingly, three determinants – relative advantage, data security, and government policy – are found to have non-significant relationships to the adoption of MDM by local government. In addition, top management support is revealed to be a cornerstone of MDM technological competence in local government. The study contributes to the theoretical, contextual, and practical knowledge of MDM and IT adoption in the context of local government. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Exploring tour member misbehavior in group package tours

ABSTRACT: model The phenomenon of tour member misbehavior is common in the practical operation of tour groups, but it hasn't been elucidated by previous studies. Hence, this study aims to explore tour member misbehavior. A qualitative approach and content analysis were conducted, resulting in five themes of tour member misbehavior: (1) misbehavior detrimental to group operation; (2) misbehavior toward the tour leader; (3) misbehavior toward tour members; (4) misbehavior toward the tourism environment; and (5) misbehavior toward tourism organizations. In addition to contributing to the current knowledge of both customer misbehavior and tour group dynamics, the prevention mechanisms and post-incident response strategies are provided to tour operators as well as tour leaders in the practice of tour guides. This study also puts forward the research limitations and the suggestions for future research direction. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Classifying residents’ roles as online place-ambassadors

ABSTRACT: Residents are pivotal in the competitiveness of tourism destinations. Yet, their role as place-brand ambassadors needs better understanding, particularly in relation to social media, which directly link visitors to residents through user-generated-content (UGC). This paper explores residents’ roles as place-brand ambassadors on Twitter, using the case of Onomichi (Japan), where decreasing population meets economic dependence on tourism. From a content analysis of residents’ tweets, four distinct roles are identified, and corresponding types of content are mapped on a two-dimensional continuum based on direct vs. Indirect word-of-mouth and the level of sentiment. Authors discuss implications for Destination Management Organizations (DMOs). Findings highlight the increasingly shifting role of residents towards being primary sources of place-marketing, especially due to social media, and as active proponents (rather than passive targets) of place-branding in the digital age. Such organic place-marketing may be the key to sustaining tourism in the face of rising anti-tourist sentiments worldwide. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Investigating the impact of cybersecurity policy awareness on employees’ cybersecurity behavior

ABSTRACT: As internet technology and mobile applications increase in volume and complexity, malicious cyber-attacks are evolving, and as a result society is facing greater security risks in cyberspace more than ever before. This study has extended the published literature on cybersecurity by theoretically defining the conceptual domains of employees’ security behavior, and developed and tested operational measures to advance information security behavior research in the workplace. A conceptual framework is proposed and tested using survey results from 579 business managers and professionals. Structural equation modeling and ANOVA procedures are employed to test the proposed hypotheses. The results show that when employees are aware of their company's information security policy and procedures, they are more competent to manage cybersecurity tasks than those who are not aware of their companies’ cybersecurity policies. The study also indicates that an organizational information security environment positively influences employees’ threat appraisal and coping appraisal abilities, which in turn, positively contribute to their cybersecurity compliance behavior. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd
