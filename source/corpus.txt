Learning Phrase Representations using RNN Encoder-Decoder for Statistical Machine Translation
.
https://www.scopus.com/blahblah
In this paper, we propose a novel neural network model called RNN Encoder-Decoder that consists of two recurrent neural networks (RNN). One RNN encodes a sequence of symbols into a fixed-length vector representation, and the other decodes the representation into another sequence of symbols. The encoder and decoder of the proposed model are jointly trained to maximize the conditional probability of a target sequence given a source sequence. The performance of a statistical machine translation system is empirically found to improve by using the conditional probabilities of phrase pairs computed by the RNN Encoder-Decoder as an additional feature in the existing log-linear model. Qualitatively, we show that the proposed model learns a semantically and syntactically meaningful representation of linguistic phrases. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Determinants of master data management adoption by local government organizations: An empirical study

https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055902313&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijinfomgt.2018.10.007&partnerID=40&md5=45ca60bec0105102ff32d6c231809066
ABSTRACT: model Master Data Management (MDM) is an approach for effective management of shared master data across organizations. In the public sector, MDM initiatives have been developed; however, the adoption among local government remains slow and there has been little interest in MDM adoption in extant research. Building on a Technology-Organization-Environment (TOE) framework, a conceptual model which highlights a set of potential determinants affecting the adoption of MDM by local government was developed. To validate the model, data were collected via survey from 224 responses from Malaysian local government department units. Using SEM-PLS, the study confirmed that data quality and data governance are two determinants of MDM adoption specific to the context of Malaysian local government, and four other determinants – complexity, top management support, technological competence, and citizen demand – are found to have significant effects on MDM adoption by local government. Surprisingly, three determinants – relative advantage, data security, and government policy – are found to have non-significant relationships to the adoption of MDM by local government. In addition, top management support is revealed to be a cornerstone of MDM technological competence in local government. The study contributes to the theoretical, contextual, and practical knowledge of MDM and IT adoption in the context of local government. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Exploring tour member misbehavior in group package tours

https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054378840&doi=10.1016%2fj.tourman.2018.09.018&partnerID=40&md5=f5c0db4bcc94f9c4c56f02273c8f9925
ABSTRACT: The phenomenon of tour member misbehavior is common in the practical operation of tour groups, but it hasn't been elucidated by previous studies. Hence, this study aims to explore tour member misbehavior. A qualitative approach and content analysis were conducted, resulting in five themes of tour member misbehavior: (1) misbehavior detrimental to group operation; (2) misbehavior toward the tour leader; (3) misbehavior toward tour members; (4) misbehavior toward the tourism environment; and (5) misbehavior toward tourism organizations. In addition to contributing to the current knowledge of both customer misbehavior and tour group dynamics, the prevention mechanisms and post-incident response strategies are provided to tour operators as well as tour leaders in the practice of tour guides. This study also puts forward the research limitations and the suggestions for future research direction. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Classifying residents’ roles as online place-ambassadors
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054875133&doi=10.1016%2fj.tourman.2018.10.008&partnerID=40&md5=a0ba727d179221745d209e50109af054
ABSTRACT: Residents are pivotal in the competitiveness of tourism destinations. Yet, their role as place-brand ambassadors needs better understanding, particularly in relation to social media, which directly link visitors to residents through user-generated-content (UGC). This paper explores residents’ roles as place-brand ambassadors on Twitter, using the case of Onomichi (Japan), where decreasing population meets economic dependence on tourism. From a content analysis of residents’ tweets, four distinct roles are identified, and corresponding types of content are mapped on a two-dimensional continuum based on direct vs. Indirect word-of-mouth and the level of sentiment. Authors discuss implications for Destination Management Organizations (DMOs). Findings highlight the increasingly shifting role of residents towards being primary sources of place-marketing, especially due to social media, and as active proponents (rather than passive targets) of place-branding in the digital age. Such organic place-marketing may be the key to sustaining tourism in the face of rising anti-tourist sentiments worldwide. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Investigating the impact of cybersecurity policy awareness on employees’ cybersecurity behavior
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055907674&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijinfomgt.2018.10.017&partnerID=40&md5=6d1c16c89cabc45c719156047a863b34
ABSTRACT: As internet technology and mobile applications increase in volume and complexity, malicious cyber-attacks are evolving, and as a result society is facing greater security risks in cyberspace more than ever before. This study has extended the published literature on cybersecurity by theoretically defining the conceptual domains of employees’ security behavior, and developed and tested operational measures to advance information security behavior research in the workplace. A conceptual framework is proposed and tested using survey results from 579 business managers and professionals. Structural equation modeling and ANOVA procedures are employed to test the proposed hypotheses. The results show that when employees are aware of their company's information security policy and procedures, they are more competent to manage cybersecurity tasks than those who are not aware of their companies’ cybersecurity policies. The study also indicates that an organizational information security environment positively influences employees’ threat appraisal and coping appraisal abilities, which in turn, positively contribute to their cybersecurity compliance behavior. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

An integrated view of particularized trust in social commerce: An empirical investigation

https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055749753&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijinfomgt.2018.10.014&partnerID=40&md5=db48ad2fe3070d7c310eab2bc899fbbd
ABSTRACT: With the prevalence of social media and social networking, social commerce is becoming increasingly popular in both business and research areas. As in other types of e-commerce context, trust is also indispensable in social commerce. In this study, two types of trust have been discussed. This study represents an initial attempt to provide an integrated view of particularized trust in social commerce, including particularized trust antecedents, trust transfer and trust performance, so as to promote trust formation in social commerce. Using data collected from 614 social commerce users, we demonstrate that trust disposition, quality-assured shared information, familiarity and endorsement by other members are four antecedents of particularized trust. The results also indicate particularized trust can be transferred into system trust, and particularized trust only exerts positive effect on social WOM intention while system trust only exerts positive effect on social shopping intention. Furthermore, we prove perceived similarity can strengthen the relationship between trust disposition and particularized trust as well as the relationship between quality-assured shared information and particularized trust. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Food waste management in hospitality operations: A critical review
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055047780&doi=10.1016%2fj.tourman.2018.10.009&partnerID=40&md5=4c1b9926cc40be753f27c04ca093714a
ABSTRACT: Hospitality food waste represents a significant societal challenge. It is however under-researched with most studies approaching the issue from the perspective of sustainable agriculture and environmental, rather than hospitality, management. Given the specificity of hospitality operations, this is a major shortcoming which hampers understanding of the determinants of effective mitigation. This paper provides a critical, analytical account of the literature on hospitality food waste made from the viewpoint of hospitality managers. It reviews the challenges in classifying, quantifying and characterising hospitality food waste, discusses the opportunities and obstacles to its mitigation and, drawing on good business practice examples, derives a framework for managing food waste across the different areas of hospitality operations. The framework is underpinned by such determinants of effective mitigation as: core in-house competencies; training needs; initial investment costs; and potential monetary savings. The feasibility of its broader adoption by managers across the sector is discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Creativity as a pragmatic moral tool
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055729483&doi=10.1016%2fj.jbusres.2018.10.009&partnerID=40&md5=44ccacefc81f80aaa712e68908c05a85
ABSTRACT: Although creativity is a truly desirable and often scarce commodity in organizations, its moral implications have not been fully explored. This research takes a new approach to investigate creativity as a moral tool, predicting that creativity generates pragmatic solutions by stimulating both unethical rule circumvention and ingenious escapes from immoral rules. The results from four complementary studies support these predictions. Specifically, Study 1 showed that when people were creative, they did not violate rules directly; instead, they were more likely to ingeniously use loopholes to circumvent the rules. Studies 2 and 3 showed that when people were creative, they circumvented moral and immoral legal ordinances for different moral motives; they also approved of moral rule circumvention more than similarly creative but immoral rule circumvention. Finally, Study 4 suggested that experiencing more workplace creativity was related to justifications of morally debatable issues (e.g., euthanasia and homosexuality) but not justifications of clearly immoral issues (e.g., bribery and cheating). The discussion section explores the theoretical and practical implications of these findings. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: To meet the maintenance of durable goods, it is considered that maintenance commitments have a significant impact on consuming decisions. To make this article more realistic, we are devoted to address maintenance commitments for goods with high expenditures to maintain under vertical integration structure. Establishing Principal-agent model of the guarantee time limited to maintain these special goods, this article argues the existence of optimal contract. In the light of the principal-agent model, the net profit of the higher efficiency maintainer is positive while the lower efficiency one attains zero profit. The vertical merger is also discussed in this work. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Promoting college student's learning motivation and creativity through a STEM interdisciplinary PBL human-computer interaction system design and development course
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055046832&doi=10.1016%2fj.tsc.2018.09.001&partnerID=40&md5=f96d49c7eb35fe572e8d890eb6af98eb
ABSTRACT: In recent years, STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics) has been extensively advocated and implemented in education, as it is suggested to be very impactful on student's interdisciplinary learning, which can be seen as a significant driving force for a country's advancement in scientific and technical knowledge, innovation, economy, and international competitiveness. Developing a human-computer interaction (HCI) system to solve real-world problems requires the inventors to have interdisciplinary STEM knowledge and skills. Thus a STEM Interdisciplinary Project-based Learning (IPBL) approach was applied to teach a total number of 45 college students registered in the departments of engineering and design. Inspired by Design Thinking, the 18-week STEM IPBL course was delivered through four phases, including discover, define, develop, and deliver. All the finished HCI projects applied the interdisciplinary knowledge and skills from the domains of STEM. Evidence drawn from the 6-point Likert ‘Motivated Strategies for Learning Questionnaire (MSLQ)’ indicated that the STEM IPBL course was very impactful on student's learning, which improved the participants’ (a) overall learning motivation (Pre M = 4.4, Post M = 4.64; p =.012), (b) self-efficacy of learning (Pre M = 4.03, Post M = 4.43; p =.003), (c) enjoyableness of learning STEM (Pre M = 4.68, Post M = 4.75; p =.556), and (d) recognizing the significance of learning STEM on future career development (Pre M = 4.73, Post M = 4.94; p =.077). It is also found that compared with design majored students, the course had a better effect on the engineering majored students. Evidence collected from ‘Abbreviated Torrance Test for Adults (ATTA)’ indicated that the student's overall creativity was significantly improved (Pre M = 63.36, Post M = 68.44; p =.000). More specifically, among the four facets of creativity, the improvements were as follows: fluency (Pre M = 14.89, Post M = 16.2; p =.001), elaboration (Pre M = 16.69, Post M = 18.62; p =.000), flexibility (Pre M = 14.82, Post M = 16.04; p =.009), and originality (Pre M = 16.96, Post M = 17.58; p =.136). It is found that the STEM IPBL course had a different impact on the student's originality, while the originality of engineering majored students significantly improved (p =.006), the originality of design majored students did not change. Some educational implications were also provided in the article. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Sugarcane propagation technologies have, in recent years, been the focus of interest of large corporations involved in the sugar and ethanol business. The objective of this study is to present the methodology used to identify the technology domain found in different sugarcane propagation technologies. The methodology was based on the bibliometric analysis of patents, including a meticulous selection of the most representative technologies used by the sugarcane market and the application of patent citation. The results report the process developed to identify a novel technology domain of high complexity involving different fields of science resulting in a set of sugar cane propagation technologies and show that the main technology advances have happened in the last decade (2005–2015), especially in seedling containers and the use of chemical compounds for seedling treatment. Further studies are recommended to help understand how these new technologies will impact the sugarcane production-chain in Brazil. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Early gestational ethanol exposure in mice: Effects on brain structure, energy metabolism and adiposity in adult offspring
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054590865&doi=10.1016%2fj.alcohol.2018.04.008&partnerID=40&md5=16f3b780fd7b4c63cdc3c9a3e9acf05b
ABSTRACT: We examined whether an early-life event – ethanol exposure in the initial stages of pregnancy – affected offspring brain structure, energy metabolism, and body composition in later life. Consumption of 10% (v/v) ethanol by inbred C57BL/6J female mice from 0.5 to 8.5 days post coitum was used to model alcohol exposure during the first 3–4 weeks of gestation in humans, when pregnancy is not typically recognized. At adolescence (postnatal day [P] 28) and adulthood (P64), the brains of male offspring were scanned ex vivo using ultra-high field (16.4 T) magnetic resonance imaging and diffusion tensor imaging. Energy metabolism and body composition were measured in adulthood by indirect calorimetry and dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry (DXA), respectively. Ethanol exposure had no substantial impact on white matter organization in the anterior commissure, corpus callosum, hippocampal commissure, internal capsule, optic tract, or thalamus. Whole brain volume and the volumes of the neocortex, cerebellum, and caudate putamen were also unaffected. Subtle, but non-significant, effects were observed on the hippocampus and the hypothalamus in adult ethanol-exposed male offspring. Ethanol exposure was additionally associated with a trend toward decreased oxygen consumption, carbon dioxide production, and reduced daily energy expenditure, as well as significantly increased adiposity, albeit with normal body weight and food intake, in adult male offspring. In summary, ethanol exposure restricted to early gestation had subtle long-term effects on the structure of specific brain regions in male offspring. The sensitivity of the hippocampus to ethanol-induced damage is reminiscent of that reported by other studies – despite differences in the level, timing, and duration of exposure – and likely contributes to the cognitive impairment that characteristically results from prenatal ethanol exposure. The hypothalamus plays an important role in regulating metabolism and energy homeostasis. Our finding of altered daily energy expenditure and adiposity in adult ethanol-exposed males is consistent with the idea that central nervous system abnormalities also underpin some of the metabolic phenotypes associated with ethanol exposure in pregnancy. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Hospitality innovation strategies: An analysis of success factors and challenges

https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054086594&doi=10.1016%2fj.tourman.2018.08.018&partnerID=40&md5=0a6560d572256308f4e24015f1ac8e21
ABSTRACT: Innovation in hospitality has attracted considerable interest, partly because its processes and activities are so diverse, and partly because its impact on performance is still a puzzle. This study proposes a comprehensive theoretical model that reviews combinations of technological and non-technological innovation and the interrelation between different innovation strategies that contribute to generating competitive advantages. Using data from 2010 and 2012 CIS, it empirically examines different innovation strategies, analyzes their role in organizational performance, and thoroughly researches sectoral variation in innovation strategies between hospitality and other service subsectors. Comparative analysis suggests that hospitality is the least innovative service activity. The findings also show that in hotels sales turnover is positively related only to complex innovation strategies that emphasize both technological and non-technological innovation. The study concludes that the level of innovation varies from sector to sector and that innovation strategies can have different effects on performance depending on the sector. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

The value of social media for innovation: A capability perspective
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054566515&doi=10.1016%2fj.jbusres.2018.10.012&partnerID=40&md5=6b63207a43b346611907352bacd43c66
ABSTRACT: Firms increasingly employ social media for innovation, yet current literature offers little guidance for developing their strategic uses. This study applies a qualitative, theory-building approach to derive a conceptual framework of the capabilities that allow companies to benefit by using social media throughout their innovation processes. This framework, designed to support applications of social media for innovation, sheds light on three key capabilities and related resources: social media managers who orchestrate social media activities across the innovation process; top management that cultivates support, team empowerment, and test-and-learn cycles; and agile processes that facilitate rapid decision making and knowledge flows across teams. This article enriches organizational capability theory as it pertains to innovation, and it provides managers with guidance for implementing social media strategies in practice. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Class capacities and climate politics: Coal and conflict in the United States energy policy-planning network
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054693322&doi=10.1016%2fj.erss.2018.09.005&partnerID=40&md5=ca769d5b0baffc437d97bcd94acc26b7
ABSTRACT: This article employs a power structure research approach and exploratory network analysis to describe the differing stances on climate action that existed within the United States elite energy policy-planning network during efforts to generate climate legislation in 2009. These divisions are explored in relation to the structural location of the coal industry, other energy sectors, and environmental organizations within the network of director interlocks. My key findings are that coal interests are well integrated into the policy-planning network with major coal producers and reserve holders most connected to ultra-conservative business policy groups and industry associations committed to climate denial while a “coal coalition” of coal-related interests provide linkages to influential moderate conservative groups and industry associations taking a conciliatory stance on climate action. The largest oil and gas firms vary more than the coal industry in their affiliations. In general, policy groups that support climate action are on average significantly less central within the overall EPPN compared to those that do not. I discuss the implications of these findings for understanding the boundaries of United States and global climate policy formation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Sources of open innovation in foreign subsidiaries: An enriched typology

ABSTRACT: This paper analyzes the drivers of multinational affiliates’ innovation, using a dataset based on the Community Innovation Survey for Belgium. Specifically, we investigate the role of external knowledge sources on foreign affiliates’ research efforts and innovation. We thereby develop an enriched typology by taking both the MNC and the host country perspective into consideration and distinguish between different types of subsidiaries, in order to disentangle differences in the use of knowledge sources between technology exploiting, seeking and creating subsidiaries. Our findings show that technology-creating foreign affiliates are able to tap into a combination of industry-based value chain partners and science-based partners. In particular, a combination of clients and universities have a powerful impetus on the research effort of technology creating firms. Our results also indicate that technology-seeking subsidiaries make more use of collaboration with competitors. Technology exploiting subsidiaries make significantly less use of external knowledge sources and have a lower R&D intensity. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Interaction effect of strategic leadership behaviors and organizational culture on IS-Business strategic alignment and Enterprise Systems assimilation

ABSTRACT: Drawing upon strategic leadership theory, this study develops a theoretical model to explore the impact of senior executives’ leadership behaviors on IS-Business strategic alignment in the context of Enterprise Systems (ES) assimilation. In particular, organizational culture is added as a critical moderator in the research model based on contingency theory. Empirical analysis results suggest that idealized influence and inspirational motivation leadership behaviors are significant drivers of IS-Business strategic alignment, which further has a positive influence on Enterprise Systems assimilation. Moreover, flexibility-oriented culture positively moderates the relationship between strategic leadership behaviors and IS-Business strategic alignment, while control-oriented culture negatively moderates the path relationships. Our study contributes to the extant literature in both leadership and IS-business strategic alignment. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

When Castro seized the Hilton: Risk and crisis management lessons from the past
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053513506&doi=10.1016%2fj.tourman.2018.09.007&partnerID=40&md5=9916397282243813e56ad4be20f9a4a8
ABSTRACT: Studies on crisis management in tourism have made valuable contributions to the sector in terms of ‘lessons learned’ offering contextualisation, analysis and synthesis of factors that influenced the development of the crisis and the organisational or destination response. Very few, however, provide information on how tourism organisations attempt to manage risk proactively and how they manage a crisis reactively. Using information from multiple sources and archival material from Hilton Hotels, this study identifies associations between the company's actions in the 1950s before the Havana Hilton's nationalisation by Castro and modern-day principles and concepts of risk and crisis management. The chronicling of the organisation's proactive actions and reactive response to that crisis richly illustrates the contemporary concept of ‘organisational resilience’ in practice. Based on this analysis, the study proposes a five-stage resilience management framework for tourism organisations which distinguishes risk from crisis management and identifies specific activities within each stage. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Knowledge agents as drivers of environmental sustainability and business performance in the hospitality sector
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053428032&doi=10.1016%2fj.tourman.2018.08.030&partnerID=40&md5=11527dea1b017b5f752466c6bc41fa05
ABSTRACT: This study examines the role of knowledge agents as key enablers in the process of creating and updating the environmental knowledge base of a firm and, in doing so, having a positive effect on business performance. From the perspective of a hotel as the most important cog in the machinery of the hospitality sector, knowledge agents are those individuals who can provide information and knowledge that enables the firm to deal with environmental issues effectively. The paper describes an empirical, longitudinal study of 87 organisations in the Spanish hospitality industry. The results highlight the importance of the relationship between knowledge agents and environmental knowledge for business performance. Furthermore, our findings indicate that the role of knowledge agents is also relevant for the future management of the environmental knowledge base of a firm within the hospitality sector. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Better together—Harnessing motivations for energy utility crowdsourcing activities

https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054433796&doi=10.1016%2fj.erss.2018.09.023&partnerID=40&md5=aacf8b7aecf4467f56b4c1547e801fba
ABSTRACT: Energy utility firms operate under varying mandates throughout most of the world and typically must operate reliably with long planning cycles and requirements to meet bureaucratic scrutiny and regulatory toll gating to achieve both discrete plan approvals as well as their ongoing licenses to operate. One vehicle for gaining external insights and involving the stakeholders is crowdsourcing. Energy utility firms have a set of distinguishing characteristics (i.e. regulatory processes and stakeholder groups) that they must consider when implementing crowdsourcing activities to aid their planning and innovation strategies. To achieve constructive participation requires understanding and engaging the motivations of the population from which a firm wishes to draw input. We assert that customers’ interest, facilitated by digital age communication channels, can provide utility operators with an accessible, valuable resource to assist a wide range of planning and innovation activities. We use the Self-Determination Theory (SDT) lens, grounded by a set of in-depth interviews with utility industry professionals, to articulate motivations for members of the external customer community to provide value to the firms through crowdsourcing activities. We develop five propositions that collectively identify how energy firms should use SDT elements to design crowdsourcing activities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Salesperson coping with work-family conflict: The joint effects of ingratiation and self-promotion
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054882098&doi=10.1016%2fj.jbusres.2018.10.015&partnerID=40&md5=1384a220c6cf14ab5da0d2179e5f59ae
ABSTRACT: Impression management tactics have recently been identified as effective strategies for coping with work stressors. However, despite the evidence that using a combination of tactics can provide more favorable outcomes than using a single tactic, previous studies have often examined impression management tactics in isolation. Furthermore, many sales organizations view their employees’ proactive behaviors as essential for gaining a competitive advantage, but our knowledge about the antecedents of proactivity at work is still limited. To address this knowledge gap, we introduce a theoretical model that explains the joint moderating effects of combining two forms of impression management tactics on the relationship between work-family conflict and salespeople's proactive behaviors. We study 249 salesperson-supervisor dyads, and the results indicate that work-family conflict is negatively related to salespeople's proactive behaviors through emotional exhaustion. In addition, the combination of ingratiation and self-promotion has a buffering effect on the relationship between work-family conflict and emotional exhaustion. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Social movements and corporate political activity: Managerial responses to socially oriented shareholder activism
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055027179&doi=10.1016%2fj.jbusres.2018.10.031&partnerID=40&md5=01e02c2eb44c624fc2cee02610fff3bf
ABSTRACT: Firms increasingly face socially oriented shareholder activists who seek to influence corporate policies and practices on a variety of issues. While extant scholarship acknowledges that firms can rebuff such external pressures, there is limited understanding of why they do so. Drawing on corporate political activity (CPA) and social activism scholarship, we hypothesize that politically active firms are more likely to fight such pressures and less likely to cooperate with social activists because CPA functions as a buffering and insurance-like mechanism that makes firms more disposed to resist such pressures. Focusing on the resolution stage of socially oriented proxy contests, we find evidence that for S&P 500 firms, politically active firms are more likely to challenge socially oriented shareholder proposals and less likely to arrive at agreements with social activists than their less politically active counterparts. Our findings contribute to and inform social activism and CPA scholarship. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Online, offline, or word-of-mouth? Complementary media usage patterns and credibility perceptions of nuclear energy information in Southeast Asia
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054383201&doi=10.1016%2fj.erss.2018.09.012&partnerID=40&md5=2d7763ebfd8ad62a2d321adbaeedf29d
ABSTRACT: Many Southeast Asian countries are considering the adoption of nuclear energy to meet the rising energy demands and achieve energy efficiency. Considering the emerging regional salience of nuclear energy, this study seeks to understand the public's media consumption patterns regarding nuclear-related information, and credibility perceptions of nuclear-related information sources in countries that are at a nascent stage of nuclear development. Focus groups were conducted with citizens aged between 18 and 69 from five Southeast Asian countries – Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam. Overall, the findings suggest that the participants utilize communication channels in a complementary manner to receive and seek nuclear-related information. Participants also evaluated the credibility of individuals and organizations that convey nuclear-related information based on their trustworthiness and nuclear expertise. The findings provide practical implications in terms of policy implementation, as well as public communication of nuclear-related information. Directions for future research were also discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85052916334&doi=10.1016%2fj.tourman.2018.08.017&partnerID=40&md5=aafb8a211d0945e4f329a70b78bf42e4
ABSTRACT: Previous research on the sharing economy has not typically focused on organizational structure and its management in spite of the fact that the essence of recent peer-to-peer business practices is the collaboration of online platforms and sharable assets owned by market peers. This paper critically examines a theoretical model to explore how these market partners engage in this platform organization and how their perceptions of attachment and ownership are established within the new organizational structure. The results of structural equation modeling applied to 224 Airbnb hosts indicate that attachment to a platform firm plays a vital role in achieving a sense of psychological ownership that ultimately influences citizenship behaviors toward the organization as well as toward peer hosts. The results suggest that the newly formed structure should acknowledge an establishing mechanism of attachment and psychological ownership in partnering with individual service providers in its operational management. © 2018

The ‘summer of discontent’: Exclusion and communal resistance at the London 2012 Olympics
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053410955&doi=10.1016%2fj.tourman.2018.08.029&partnerID=40&md5=3ac37d38de820097a0dcc85e568fce0e
ABSTRACT: London 2012 promised local small businesses access to lucrative Olympic event-tourism and visitor trading opportunities. However, as urban spaces were transformed to stage live Games, many local stakeholders found themselves locked out. We focus on one ‘host’ community, Central Greenwich, who emerged negatively impacted by such conditions. 43 in-depth interviews and secondary evidence reveal that this was a community determined to resist. Few papers have extended the concept of resistance to the context of mega-events so we examine why communities resisted, and how physical tactics and creative resistance were deployed. Although efforts afforded some access for local businesses - they proved too little, too late. We develop and present a ‘tactics for resistance’ approach, a series of ‘hard’ and ‘soft’ tactics businesses could use to encourage proactive, as opposed to reactive, communal resistance required to protect local interests and afford access to opportunities generated by temporary mega-event visitor economies. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Short- and medium-run impacts of management training: An experiment in Tanzania
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055205483&doi=10.1016%2fj.worlddev.2018.10.002&partnerID=40&md5=043d8c055747850bc83d794339d7a2a4
ABSTRACT: While entrepreneurs play a key role in industrial development, the managerial capacity of those in developing countries seems limited. A number of randomized controlled trials have been conducted to evaluate the impacts of management training, coaching, or consultation programs. These studies found that the interventions had positive impacts on management knowledge and management practices, but the impacts on business performance—measured in terms of sales revenue, value added, or profit—were often statistically insignificant. Such mixed results may be attributed to experiment designs, including training content and the time elapsed till the follow-up observation. The present study attempts to substantiate this hypothesis by means of a randomized controlled trial of management training in Tanzania that targets 113 small manufacturers. As in some recent studies, it extends the observation period to three years to examine the trajectory of training impacts. Unlike many other studies, it is an impact assessment of training programs that covered quality control and production management as the training topics in addition to entrepreneurship, marketing, and record keeping. The treated firms made adaptive efforts to select useful practices and modify them to fit their business operation. It finds that the training effects on business performance are large and statistically significant, particularly in the medium-run. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Inclusion fairness in accounting, finance, and management: An investigation of A-star publications on the ABDC journal list
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055208701&doi=10.1016%2fj.jbusres.2018.10.035&partnerID=40&md5=dc46a2462e00afef481f6e0207d612b2
ABSTRACT: Substantial research has examined inclusion fairness, which is whether a fair distribution of available publication space exists in quality journals across the functional disciplines of business. Historically, researchers have assessed inclusion fairness using the top two to four journals in each discipline. This study examines inclusion fairness using the Australian Business Deans Council list, which is a much more inclusive sample of quality journals. Using hand-collected data from 11746 articles in accounting, finance, and management, and standardized faculty counts of AACSB accredited institutions, we find evidence against inclusion fairness as the number of articles published per faculty member as well as the number of authors per paper are larger for management than for accounting and finance. Further, while A-star publications in management are distributed among a very large pool of academic institutions, publications in accounting and finance are limited to a much smaller and more elite group of institutions. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Facilitating intercultural negotiated practices in joint ventures: The case of a French–German railway organization
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050006805&doi=10.1016%2fj.ibusrev.2018.06.001&partnerID=40&md5=14fa90323520062f79892b1569adb066
ABSTRACT: In this paper, we show how new work and managerial practices emerge in international joint ventures (IJVs), how they are co-constructed by cultural negotiating processes over time, and how this co-construction can provide synergistic effects. We use the case study of a binational railway organization which coordinates activities of its parent companies, DB and SNCF, between France and Germany, to focus on emerging practices, and use the framework of Brannen and Salk (2000) to categorize these practices. Our study centres on factors that facilitate the development of synergistic practices: organizational and communication structures, individual skills and socialization of IJV actors, and interpersonal relationships and learning processes in “boundary spanning dyads”. Where previous studies typically insist on boundary spanners as individuals, we specifically highlight the important role of boundary spanning dyads and relationships. © 2018

Policy uncertainty and firm cash holdings
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054428172&doi=10.1016%2fj.jbusres.2018.10.001&partnerID=40&md5=b54de5e26be44a64342f5e5612846e36
ABSTRACT: This research examines the relation between government economic policy uncertainty and firm cash holdings. We find evidence that policy uncertainty is positively related to firm cash holdings due to firms’ precautionary motives and, to a lesser extent, investment delays. The relation between policy uncertainty and cash holdings is more pronounced for firms dependent on government spending and extends beyond business cyclicality. Further analysis indicates that the effects of policy uncertainty on corporate cash holdings are distinct from those of political, market, or other macroeconomic uncertainty. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Multi-scalar energy transitions in rural households: Distributed photovoltaics as a circuit breaker to the energy poverty cycle in India
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054261475&doi=10.1016%2fj.erss.2018.09.013&partnerID=40&md5=1b6685f45fd433c0e6b18066a6744e9d
ABSTRACT: A transformation in energy structures and governance models are required to meet the needs of communities living in rural and remote areas and particularly for those subject to energy and economic poverty. New models must be reflexive to global climate concerns, align with social, economic and environmental agendas of national, state, and local governments, and be compatible with embedded energy infrastructure. Decentralised solar solutions are a resilient technology which can support energy transformation to spatially, economically and socially disadvantaged communities yet the deployment of this technology is hamstrung by path dependencies including policy frameworks, business models and infrastructure. In this study, the multi-level perspective has been used to examine energy transformation within rural and remote communities in India through interviews with regime and niche level actors. We identify various barriers impeding successful deployment of decentralised solar PV including a disconnect between policy makers and implementers, poor coordination within and between actors, and limited institutional focus and competence. To support a successful transition to off-grid solar based regimes for rural and remote communities, participants suggested strong political determination, setting enabling policy frameworks, and implementing a collaborative ecosystem with businesses, system suppliers, financial intermediaries, distribution companies, civil society and end users. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Exploring barriers of m-commerce adoption in SMEs in the UK: Developing a framework using ISM
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055657650&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijinfomgt.2018.10.009&partnerID=40&md5=8834637ba71d7d7bbed5335b17e7fc68
ABSTRACT: In the modern business era, mobile commerce (m-commerce) is changing the way the business is conducted using the Internet. However, the prominence of m-commerce among small and medium-sized enterprises (SMEs) in the UK is minimal. The purpose of this study is to evaluate the existing literature and to extend the research surrounding the barriers that prevent the adoption of m-commerce amongst SMEs. The study uses an Interpretive Structural Modelling (ISM) and MICMAC approach for guiding and helping managers of SMEs. Data was collected from an expert participant group each of whom had extensive knowledge of m-commerce. The findings represent the unstable nature of variables in the context of their impact on each other, their relationships, and themselves. The listed factors in the proposed framework and the interrelationships between them highlight the multi-dimensional element of m-commerce adoption prevention. This observation proves criticality of analysing data as a collective entity rather than viewing the barriers in isolation. The findings also indicated ‘perceived risk’ being a key barrier that demonstrates how personal opinions of the concept of adoption can have a great significance on the outcome and whether other variables will come into effect. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

The link between information processing capability and competitive advantage mediated through decision-making effectiveness
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055164367&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijinfomgt.2018.10.003&partnerID=40&md5=29fa1dff17b998522153006f6a8c61e4
ABSTRACT: While research underpinned by the resource-based view (RBV) appears to suggest that IT-enabled capabilities are positively linked to competitive advantage, such a link is often seen as a black box as the processes through which competitive advantage can be gained appears unclear. In particular, research appears to suggest that information processing capability is linked to decision-making effectiveness and competitive advantage; however, little research appears to examine the interrelationship among them. This study, drawing on the RBV, develops a mediation model to examine the link between competitive advantage and the key tenets of value, rarity, inimitability and non-substitutability of information processing capability in the context of business analytics; and whether this link is mediated through decision-making effectiveness. Based on data collected from 633 UK companies, this study shows that there is a positive link between the value, rarity and inimitability characteristics of information processing capability and competitive advantage, which is partially mediated by decision-making effectiveness. The findings contribute to the theoretical development of the RBV by developing a mediation model that looks inside the black box. They also contribute to managers’ knowledge and understanding of the mechanism through which the strategic value of information processing capability can be maximized. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Fear and loathing of electric vehicles: The reactionary rhetoric of range anxiety
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054445114&doi=10.1016%2fj.erss.2018.10.001&partnerID=40&md5=be8065da3b5a59452f98d4bb8f1ea2e4
ABSTRACT: “Range anxiety,” defined as the psychological anxiety a consumer experiences in response to the limited range of an electric vehicle, continues to be labelled and presented as one of the most pressing barriers to their mainstream diffusion. As a result, academia, policymakers and even industry have focused on addressing the range anxiety barrier in order to accelerate adoption. Much literature recognizes that range anxiety is increasingly psychological, rather than technical, in its nature. However, we argue in this paper that even psychological and technical explanations are incomplete. We examine range anxiety through Hirschman's Rhetoric of Reaction, which supposes that conservative forces may oppose change by propagating theses related to jeopardy, perversity, and futility. To do so, we use three qualitative methods to understand the role of range anxiety triangulated via a variety of perspectives: 227 semi-structured interviews with experts at 201 institutions, a survey with nearly 5000 respondents, and 8 focus groups, all across 17 cities in the five Nordic countries. We find evidence where consumers and experts use and perpetuate the rhetoric of reaction, particularly the jeopardy thesis. We conclude with a reexamination of the policies geared to assuage range-based barriers, which a construction of range anxiety as a rhetorical excuse would render as ineffective or inefficient, as well as future implications for diffusion theory. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Cause-related marketing and employee engagement: The roles of admiration, implicit morality beliefs, and moral identity
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054597885&doi=10.1016%2fj.jbusres.2018.10.013&partnerID=40&md5=7067e07a28e7c27f52620b9dfeac8839
ABSTRACT: Cause-related marketing refers to supporting a charitable cause or a non-profit organization to promote sales. Little is known about how cause-related marketing influences a firm's own employees. Two field studies were conducted which confirmed that cause-related marketing enhances employees' admiration for their company, which in turn promotes engagement. Importantly, each employee's implicit morality beliefs and moral identity centrality jointly moderate these relationships. The practical implications of these findings are discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Born globals – presence, performance and prospects

ABSTRACT: The concept born global firms has gained a spectacular increase in interest from both academic and political circles. Rigorous quantitative treatment of born global firms are however rare in the international business/economics literature. Implementing unique data on all Swedish start-ups during 1998–2008 in the manufacturing sector, we conclude that born global firms are a very rare event, that their prevalence seems invariant to time, and that they perform similar to other matched “twin” firms with regard to profitability and productivity but report a considerably higher growth in employment and sales. These results are robust to a wider definition of born global firms and to the timing of performance measurements. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Within-country religious diversity and the performance of private participation infrastructure projects
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054311719&doi=10.1016%2fj.jbusres.2018.08.027&partnerID=40&md5=58f4c42a34759b47fac295be01d5d2df
ABSTRACT: This paper investigates the impact of within-country religious diversity on the performance of private participation infrastructure projects. Our analysis of 8139 projects in 33 countries (1990–2014) shows that higher levels of within-country religious diversity are associated with a higher risk of project failure. This negative effect is exacerbated in greenfield projects and when a project's main sponsor is a foreign firm. In contrast, we find no moderation effect for local government ownership. The study contributes to the ongoing debate regarding the effects of within-country diversity on foreign business ventures. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Brand USA: A natural quasi-experiment evaluating the success of a national marketing campaign
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050825126&doi=10.1016%2fj.tourman.2018.07.013&partnerID=40&md5=592c8d120af502e4c2dbfa589408275b
ABSTRACT: As national, state, and local governments implement strategic place branding and marketing plans, questions remain about how to best measure the success of such endeavors. Using a natural quasi-experimental design, we evaluate how well marketing efforts from Brand USA achieve intended tourism goals. Brand USA was created in 2009 to market the country abroad. Based on air travel data collected from the National Travel and Tourism Office, Brand USA reports, and economic indicators from the World Bank, we find Brand USA's marketing efforts have little effect on inbound international travel to the US, thus showing a potential weakness in place marketing efforts abroad. Findings suggest the organization may decrease the effectiveness of the complex branding campaign. © 2018

Spatially dispersed corporate headquarters: A historical analysis of their prevalence, antecedents, and consequences
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054080110&doi=10.1016%2fj.ibusrev.2018.07.002&partnerID=40&md5=1a4c96a94300ee3e4730e0d41b58001d
ABSTRACT: Our study, which complements recent works challenging the traditional conceptualization of the CHQ as a single organizational unit, has a dual purpose. First, in descriptive terms, we set out to explore the prevalence of spatially dispersed CHQs in a historical context. Second, we aim to shed additional light on the CHQ's spatial design by exploring internal antecedents and potential consequences. Building on arguments from information-processing theory, we propose that the strategic complexity facing the CHQ (affecting its information-processing demands) is associated with the likelihood of a spatially dispersed CHQ (affecting its information-processing capacity). In line with our dual purpose, we conduct a historical study drawing on survey and archival data covering 156 public firms domiciled in four countries (Germany, the Netherlands, the UK, and the US) in the late 1990s. Our results provide empirical support for the hypothesized associations between strategic complexity and the CHQ's spatial design. Moreover, although we find no empirical support for the expected contingency effects, the results suggest that a spatially dispersed CHQ can have negative effects on CHQ and firm performance. Overall, our theoretical arguments and empirical results advance our knowledge about complex CHQ configurations. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Towards a big data framework for analyzing social media content
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053786247&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijinfomgt.2018.09.003&partnerID=40&md5=1746c0e07180aa353d770eef77d94674
ABSTRACT: Modern companies generate value by digitalizing their services and products. Knowing what customers are saying about the firm through reviews in social media content constitutes a key factor to succeed in the big data era. However, social media data analysis is a complex discipline due to the subjectivity in text review and the additional features in raw data. Some frameworks proposed in the existing literature involve many steps that thereby increase their complexity. A two-stage framework to tackle this problem is proposed: the first stage is focused on data preparation and finding an optimal machine learning model for this data; the second stage relies on established layers of big data architectures focused on getting an outcome of data by taking most of the machine learning model of stage one. Thus, a first stage is proposed to analyze big and small datasets in a non-big data environment, whereas the second stage analyzes big datasets by applying the first stage machine learning model of. Then, a study case is presented for the first stage of the framework to analyze reviews of hotel-related businesses. Several machine learning algorithms were trained for two, three and five classes, with the best results being found for binary classification. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

All that glitters is not green: Creating trustworthy ecofriendly services at green hotels
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85052054745&doi=10.1016%2fj.tourman.2018.08.015&partnerID=40&md5=71c4e99849912d2a7dcfa8195e5bf931
ABSTRACT: While there is much emphasis on authentic green practices, there is rising concern about the common practice of “greenwashing” or unsubstantiated claims about good environmental policies. Consequently, tourism businesses need to provide tangible evidences to create trust in their green claims. This paper, building on a sequential mixed method approach of data collection, proposes a potential green service encounter (GSE) framework by which hotel management can reassure customers and secure long-term patronage. Moderating role to two key contextual variables, travel purpose and environmental values of travelers, is investigated. Practical implications indicate that hotels should offer guests opportunities for enhanced involvement in GSE that help build consumer trust. The trust building process is dependent on a traveler's environmental values but independent of trip purpose. The GSE framework conceptualization included interviews with 25 green hotel guests and a panel of experts while empirical validation involved a sample of over 500 respondents. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Exploring the male Chinese tourists’ motivation for commercial sex when travelling overseas: Scale construction and validation
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054002360&doi=10.1016%2fj.tourman.2018.09.014&partnerID=40&md5=ec2d0c8fb9d6d797c59013a23154381b
ABSTRACT: Sex and tourism has long been understudied. Little is known about tourists' motivations for consuming commercial sex while travelling, and even less, if indeed anything, is known about that of Chinese outbound tourists in particular. Based on twenty interviews and two surveys with a sample of 534 male Chinese tourists who had engaged in commercial sex when travelling overseas in the previous 12 months, this study aimed first to explore why male Chinese tourists travelled overseas and purchased commercial sex, and second to construct a comprehensive scale for measuring male tourists’ motivations for overseas commercial sex. With acceptable reliability and validity, the measurement scale yielded in this study consisted of eight motivation dimensions labelled as socialisation, relaxation and escape, travel-related novelty, sexual desire fulfillment/excitement seeking, sex-related learning, sexual mastery, social prestige, and business/pragmatic purpose. Both the theoretical and methodological implications related to the developed scale are also discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Case study: Destination readiness for dementia-friendly visitor experiences: A scoping study
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050821750&doi=10.1016%2fj.tourman.2018.05.013&partnerID=40&md5=b821575f841277df8b834d850520b608
ABSTRACT: Ageing and dementia are major societal challenges affecting many countries, with around 46.8 million people worldwide estimated to be living with dementia. These estimates suggest that the worldwide population of people living with dementia will double every 20 years to reach 131.5 million by 2050. Recognition that dementia is a significant challenge for the travel and tourism sector is starting to develop. This paper contributes to this emerging agenda on ageing and dementia focusing on the accessibility needs of this group through a two-stage research study that demonstrates the practical needs and leadership challenges this poses for the tourism sector. Using the UK as an exemplar of dementia-readiness, the study examines Destination Management Organisation (DMO) website provision of advice for people with dementia and their carers. It then reports the findings of a survey DMO managers attitudes towards creating dementia-friendly destinations. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

From frontier governance to governance frontier: The political geography of Brazil's Amazon transition
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054412388&doi=10.1016%2fj.worlddev.2018.09.022&partnerID=40&md5=4b06dca07a16fe92a9da9a7af7584616
ABSTRACT: The ‘frontier’ is central to a new wave of development scholarship, but the broad deployment of the concept has blurred several key dimensions of frontier development. We focus on the Brazilian Amazon to synthesize classical frontier theory and emerging perspectives with special attention to the role of governance in frontier development. Since 2004, primary deforestation in the Brazilian Amazon has declined over 70 percent while agricultural production in the region has increased. Contrary to narratives that view this transition as the result of ‘frontier governance’ – i.e., the imposition of order on a pre-existing frontier – we propose the concept of a ‘governance frontier,’ which recognizes the role of politics in constructing and transforming frontier spaces. This concept politicizes economic accounts of frontier development and spatializes abstract notions of governance. We employ a ‘follow the policy’ methodology to trace the evolution of a governance frontier in the eastern Brazilian Amazon, drawing on original fieldwork across four Amazonian municipalities and inside an environmental non-governmental organization. We show that a key feature of the Amazonian governance frontier has been a distinct geographical configuration of ‘model municipalities’ that function as nodes of policy experimentation, legitimation, and transfer. Our findings support an integration of frontier theory and governance theory in a place-based, political geography approach to regional political-economic transformation, which demands greater attention to the political dimensions of frontiers and to the spatial dimensions of governance. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Effects of preservation policy on land use changes in Iranian Northern Zagros forests
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055649222&doi=10.1016%2fj.landusepol.2018.10.036&partnerID=40&md5=c6660e93e5a85fcbc589cf38ea388eb0
ABSTRACT: Zagros Forest provides various ecosystem services such as food, timber, water, carbon storage, air purification, wildlife habitat as well as social and cultural benefits for both humans and animals. Due to the economic expansion beginning in the early 1990s in Iran and its resulting desertification, Zagros has lost numerous forests over the last 30 years. To overcome this issue, Zagros Forest Preservation Plan (ZFPP) has been under implementation in Northwestern Iran since 2003 to reduce forest destruction and attract the people's participation. However, it faced shortcomings caused by a variety of factors including insufficient funds, incomplete preservation, and unsuitable organization during implementation. This research aims to study the effect of ZFPP on forest loss in Sardasht County as a representative of Iranian Northern Zagros Forests. A series of Landsat images were used to analyze the forest loss before ZFPP implementation (1993–2002), after 10 years of implementation (2002–2012), and finally after its revision (2012–2016). Land Change Modeler (LCM) was employed to detect land cover changes for land cover prediction in 2024. We used land cover maps between 2002 and 2012 for calibration. We then compared the predicted land cover map from LCM with actual land cover map in 2016 for validation. The results indicated that 3330, 4562, and 1234 ha of forestlands converted to agricultural lands, rangelands, and built-up areas during 1993–2002, 2002–2012, and 2012–2016, with annual deforestation rates of -0.40%, -0.52% and -0.36%, respectively. The highest deforestation rate was observed between 2002 and 2012 because of the destructive effects of population growth. Land cover prediction indicated that per capita forest area would continue to decline while the other land cover uses would continue to grow more severely around the existing agricultural lands and built-up areas in Sardasht until 2024. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

The R/evolution of civic engagement: an exploratory network analysis of the Facebook groups of occupy Chicago
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85028800152&doi=10.1080%2f1369118X.2017.1371786&partnerID=40&md5=b577b9c00a633b64186bda151c0cb563
ABSTRACT: This study explores the role of social media as mediating structures for civic engagement. A network analysis of 2829 Facebook groups joined by 600 randomly sampled occupy Chicago (OC) participants shows that OC is embedded in diverse interconnected voluntary groups mediated by social media. The observed patterns of interconnection reveal a loosely connected, fragmented, and clustered structure. Such a structure may enable publics, as self-organized social groups shaped in networked flows of communication, to shift in and out of more established institutional structures and formal civic organizations to form ‘flexible network-domains’ at developing moments of mobilization. The study explains the empirical patterns of civic affiliation in the context of the broad historical structural changes and the specific characteristics of contemporary forms of mediated sociality. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Governance by campaign: the co-constitution of food issues, publics and expertise through new information and communication technologies
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85028554979&doi=10.1080%2f1369118X.2017.1363264&partnerID=40&md5=5e7f188ebe4fed4f36d3a3bb83cc822c
ABSTRACT: This paper considers food as a site of public engagement with science and technology. Specifically, we focus on how public engagement with food is envisioned and operationalised by one non-profit organisation, foodwatch. Founded in Germany in 2002, foodwatch extensively uses new information and communication technologies to inform consumers about problematic food industry practices. In this paper, we present our analysis of 50 foodwatch e-newsletters published over a period of one year (2013). We define foodwatch’s approach as ‘governance by campaign’–an approach marked by simultaneously constituting: (a) key food governance issues, (b) affective publics that address these topics of governance through ICT-enabled media and (c) independent food and food-related expertise. We conclude our paper with a discussion of foodwatch’s mode of ‘governance by campaign’ and the democratic limits and potentials of a governance mode that is based on invited participation. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041620153&doi=10.1080%2f08874417.2017.1289356&partnerID=40&md5=16f5b7b4ddc9273058c107a2d362d324
ABSTRACT: Organizations have recognized the revenue potential for social commerce (purchasing products via social networks), but such transactions only comprise a small percentage of revenue. Companies have yet to determine the factors that contribute to social commerce failure. In social networking, trust is established when two parties have a history of trustworthy interactions. Acknowledging that social commerce represents a fundamentally different purchasing environment than typical business transactions, we examine the role of trust in determining consumers’ decisions to engage in social commerce for their purchases. We apply trust transfer theory to the social commerce context to assess whether trust in known entities can be transferred to business transactions facilitated through a social network with unknown parties. Using a field survey, we found that trust in the Internet and trust in firms significantly influence consumers’ trust and ultimately their intention to engage in social commerce. Implications for research and practice are discussed. © 2019, © 2019 International Association for Computer Information Systems.

Examining Factors that Influence Intent to Adopt Data Science

https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041601447&doi=10.1080%2f08874417.2017.1295790&partnerID=40&md5=19c378a493e63b35bd147c29cef491f9
ABSTRACT: Data science is a relatively new and emerging field with strong job growth projections. In this work, we develop a new theoretical model based on the theory of planned behavior and the IS Success Model in order to understand public perceptions about data science. Specifically, we aim to determine the potential impact and if the public views data science as beneficial to organizations and society and whether this in turn leads to an intent to use data science. In order to answer the aforementioned questions, we develop a definition of data science derived from current, state-of-the-art literature. Next, we test our theoretical model via a survey instrument that adapts relevant constructs from academic literature. Results indicate support for our model and subsequent hypotheses which show that information quality and system quality impact social norms and behavioral control which in turn influences perceived benefits of data science which influences the intent to use data science. Our model can be employed to advance the adoption of data science as a tool for business and data driven decision-making as well as position academia to train future generations of data scientists. © 2019, © 2019 International Association for Computer Information Systems.

The effect of comment moderation on perceived bias in science news

https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026401204&doi=10.1080%2f1369118X.2017.1356861&partnerID=40&md5=8d2119dcdb7045f2e03ee0605660a26f
ABSTRACT: Uncivil comments following online news articles about issues of science and technology have been shown to lead to biased interpretations of the news content itself. Using an experiment embedded in a nationally representative survey, we provide evidence that cues about comment moderation ‒ even without any change in the comments themselves ‒ have the potential to alleviate this so-called nasty effect. Participants exposed to uncivil comments that appear in a moderated environment were less likely to perceive bias in the news article itself. Importantly, perceptions of bias among respondents exposed to the uncivil, moderated stimulus were comparable to those of respondents who viewed both moderated and unmoderated civil comments. Our results suggest that visible cues about comment moderation are a potentially valuable endeavor for news organizations, especially in an age of declining profit margins. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

A Factor Analysis of Consumer Expectations for Autonomous Cars
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85041633126&doi=10.1080%2f08874417.2017.1295791&partnerID=40&md5=f8fd4a5dc37ddc19db778ba470462268
ABSTRACT: This study explores consumers’ expectations for autonomous cars in Korea, which will soon be available. We applied exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses to derive consumer expectations using responses from 1,506 potential autonomous car consumers. Then, we carried out a structural equation analysis to identify relationships among expectations, attitude, and behavioral intention. Seven consumer expectations were identified; of these, convenience, safety, ethics, licensing, and monetary cost were found to have a direct effect on attitude, whereas convenience, safety, and monetary cost were found to have a direct effect on intention. In addition, we demonstrate that attitude has a significant effect on intention. Autonomous cars are driving innovation in the automotive industry, transportation systems, and consumer experience. By analyzing the main factors that affect consumers’ purchasing intentions prior to the release of autonomous cars, this study provides guidance for fields preparing for the launch of autonomous cars. © 2019, © 2019 International Association for Computer Information Systems.

Building a hidden investment state? The European Investment Bank, national development banks and European economic governance

https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055387430&doi=10.1080%2f13501763.2017.1382556&partnerID=40&md5=a7c853605c7208ec77f8e05b1773b57f
ABSTRACT: The European Commission’s Investment Plan for Europe and the enduring economic crisis has brought state-owned development banks again to the fore of public and scholarly debate in Europe. This article proposes to place these banks’ activities and recent institutional co-operation in the context of European integration and assumes a historical perspective on European economic governance and development banking. Most importantly, it argues that the European Investment Bank has become a centre of gravity in long-standing political attempts to increase the investment firepower of the European Union. Based on detailed process-tracing analysis through publicly available data and interview material, the article delineates a gradual process of institutional innovation and network formation that advanced since the late 1980s and culminated in recent post-crisis policy processes. The contemporary visibility of development banking in Europe, we conclude, follows from these and is representative of a nucleus for a–somewhat hidden–European investment state, whose reach and stability, however, is yet to be determined. © 2017, © 2017 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050129341&doi=10.4067%2fS0718-18762019000100104&partnerID=40&md5=10f79f75ac50c968278906f68f550a54
ABSTRACT: The aim of this paper is to examine the individual and interactive influence of organizational, technical and environmental factors on the diffusion of e-business in Montenegrin tourism organizations. In accordance with this goal a decision tree method is used in this paper. The results showed that organizational factors have the highest individual impact on e-business diffusion and that there is a strong interactive influence of organizational, information technology integration and external support factors. The obtained results provide important information for management and decision-making in conditions when diffusion of information technology innovation needs to be accelerated in such a way that instead of influencing only one group of factors, it affects several factors simultaneously which, in interaction with one another, lead to a greater degree of e-business diffusion. © 2019 Universidad de Talca-Chile.

The roles of absorptive capacity and cultural balance for exploratory and exploitative innovation in SMEs
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85034440776&doi=10.1016%2fj.jbusres.2017.10.052&partnerID=40&md5=5f65ed57adb58eb6674764cbd99c4453
ABSTRACT: This study investigates whether balanced forms of organizational cultures moderate the effects of potential and realized absorptive capacities (ACs) to simultaneously generate exploratory and exploitative innovations. Using empirical survey data collected from 138 small to medium-sized enterprises (SMEs), we applied partial least squares (PLS) structural equation modeling (SEM) combined with mediation and moderation analyses to test our hypotheses. Our results show that the effects of potential AC on organizations’ exploratory and exploitative innovations are fully mediated by the organizations’ realized AC. The positive effects of realized AC on innovation are contingent on the overall cultural balance of the organization, which, however, does not affect the strong link between potential AC and realized AC. We thus provide novel empirical insights into the multi-dimensional nature of AC and the importance of cultural equilibrium for both exploratory and exploitative innovation, which is of particular importance for ambidextrous SMEs facing dynamic markets. © 2017 The Authors

ABSTRACT: Knowledge sharing is crucial for attaining a competitive edge in organizations. Knowledge and performance motivate organizations to launch new innovative products and services to sustain market advantages among competitors. Many factors have been shown to be determinants for supporting organizational performance growth, one of which is organizational culture. The objective of this paper is to analyze the organizational culture that supports knowledge sharing activities for organizational performance, innovation and strategy. This paper uses a sample of 107 cases to examine the empirical data. The results demonstrate the role of organizational culture with an innovative strategy in knowledge sharing, which directly contributes to the improvement of organizational performance. Using fsQCA, this paper relates the impact of organizational culture on the business activities within an organization. The main findings of this paper analyze and test the relation between organizational culture and knowledge sharing components for organizational strategies. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046708267&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijhm.2018.04.009&partnerID=40&md5=f703765a14057609f5b95e4619a0828d
ABSTRACT: The purpose of this paper is to explore how sustainable human resource management (HRM) practices impact the innovation-customer satisfaction relationship in Swedish hotels. Responding hotels were profiled into four groups based on their involvement in two sustainable HR practices. The findings indicate the relationship between innovation and customer satisfaction is dependent on sustainable HR practices in the organization. Although innovation and sustainable HR practices impact customer satisfaction positively, their interaction suggests that the one can substitute the other to achieve superior customer satisfaction. The study concludes that sustainable HR practices enhance a hotel's capability to innovate and to have satisfied customers. The relationship between sustainable HR practices and innovation is discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Relying on resource dependence theory and transaction cost economics, this article discusses the important role of alliance governance as a mediating mechanism in the relationship between market orientation and innovation, and compares the differences between the influences of different dimensions. The article aims to reveal the influence mechanism of different types of alliance governance on the relationship between market orientation and innovation. Based on a sample of 122 Chinese manufacturing enterprises, the article finds that: (1) contractual governance will increase when customer orientation and competitor orientation become higher, and contractual governance will affect radical innovation in a U-shaped way; (2) trust governance will increase when inter-functional coordination become higher, and trust governance has a positive impact on both radical innovation and incremental innovation (II).

Collaboration in project teams: The role of mastery and performance climates
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054695909&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijproman.2018.09.006&partnerID=40&md5=02750960fe15f5266b9fd02519158de2
ABSTRACT: Over the last years, project work in teams has become commonplace in organizations. Studies have indicated that the motivational climate in which teams operate is highly relevant in determining employee behavior. This study investigates the effect of motivational climates, as defined by goal setting theory, on collaboration in project teams. In a survey among 173 senior project members from different organizations, we found that congruence between performance and mastery climates is positively and significantly related to collaboration behavior in teams. Furthermore, we highlight the moderating role of prosocial motivation in the relationship between (in)congruence in motivational climates and collaboration. Specifically, we find that under conditions of low prosocial motivation, a focus on either a mastery or a performance climate is preferable to adopting a congruence between these two climates, at least in terms of collaboration in teams. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd, APM and IPMA

Effective sense-and-respond strategies: Mediating roles of exploratory and exploitative innovation
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85032892623&doi=10.1016%2fj.jbusres.2017.10.050&partnerID=40&md5=40adb92c82033dd4d6d55b5ca96978e8
ABSTRACT: Integrating the dynamic capabilities view of the firm with ambidexterity theory, this article proposes a sense-and-respond performance framework, in which technology- and market-sensing capabilities drive explorative and exploitative innovation activities, which then determine firm performance in an emerging market. With a sample of 150 Vietnamese firms, this study shows that exploratory and exploitative innovations are salient modi operandi through which the effects of technology-sensing and market-sensing capabilities affect firm performance. No performance-related empirical evidence supports the proposed complementarity between exploratory innovation and exploitative innovation. Instead, the findings imply that a firm's ability to compete in a complex market depends on its possession of adaptive capabilities. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

An approach to characterize and evaluate the quality of Product Lifecycle Management Software Systems
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048322466&doi=10.1016%2fj.csi.2018.05.003&partnerID=40&md5=1a301c87bb275390bfd272064caa0313
ABSTRACT: PLM (Product Lifecycle Management) is an information management system that can integrate data, processes, business systems and staff in a company, in general. PLM allows managing efficiently and economically the information that all these elements generate from the initial idea to design, manufacture, maintenance and elimination phases of the product lifecycle. PLM has to include processes and tools to assure the quality of the final products. This way, it is difficult for PLM experts (from aeronautical or automation organizations, among others) to find an environment that suggests which is the best PLM solution that copes with their necessities. A number of PLM solutions are available for this purpose, but experts require a suitable mechanism to select the most appropriate one for the specific context of each organization. For this purpose, this paper presents a quality model, based on QuEF (Quality Evaluation Framework), that aims at helping organizations choose the most useful PLM solution for their particular environments. This model supports both static and dynamic aspects that may be customized for any kind of organization and taken as reference model. Particularly, our approach has been validated in the context of large enterprises in the aeronautical industry within a real R&D project carried out between our research group and Airbus. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Organizational E-mentoring and learning: An exploratory study

ABSTRACT: This article explores the process by which e-mentoring unfolds in organizational settings, emphasizing the crucial role of learning that acts as the intermediate step between mentoring functions and organizational outcomes. Specifically, the authors investigate how e-mentoring functions - career support, psycho-social, and role modeling - support the protégé's learning, and how learning increases organizational commitment of the protégés. Data was collected through an online survey of 59 individuals in two multinational organizations that had mentoring programs. Analysis using SmartPLS 3.0 showed that career and role modeling support are statistically significant predictors of learning, and learning predicts organizational commitment as expected. Contrary to face-to-face mentoring literature, the direct link between the mentoring functions and organizational commitment is not supported. The authors conclude with implications for research and practice. © 2019, IGI Global.

Customer disposition to social exchange in Co-innovation
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047430301&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijhm.2018.05.018&partnerID=40&md5=44c6a79913e02e267eaabf39583b6e70
ABSTRACT: Hospitality research lacks an understanding of customer-driven innovation and the effects of customers’ psychological characteristics on the success of co-innovation. This paper aimed to examine the role of social exchange ideology in customers’ disposition to social exchange in hospitality co-innovation. The research employed a 2 (co-innovation initiation: customer vs. company) x 2 (disposition to social exchange: strong vs. weak) between-subjects design. Bridging relational aspects of service-dominant logic and social exchange theory, co-innovation contributed to relationship development between a hospitality company and customers through mutually beneficial relational outcomes, operationalized as satisfaction, loyalty and trust. As one of the first studies to examine customers’ disposition to social exchange, it established two dimensions: tangible and intangible. Disposition to exchange moderated the effects of co-innovation initiation on satisfaction and partially moderated paths to loyalty and trust. Hospitality providers should focus on customers with strong intangible social exchange disposition and, in most cases, initiate co-innovation to achieve strong relational outcomes of loyalty and trust. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Social media information benefits, knowledge management and smart organizations

https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046820532&doi=10.1016%2fj.jbusres.2018.05.005&partnerID=40&md5=1ca3883d90f9033225e69cbdd3aee713
ABSTRACT: Social technologies can provide a potent means for organizations to manage their information flows and thus induce changes in their knowledge management (KM) systems, which can then be linked to performance improvements. This paper examines the growth of social media within organizations, considering the impact this may have upon knowledge sharing in a particular type of KM system - Community of Practice - (CoP) based discussion groups (KMDG). We focus on this KM tool because it provides employees with an opportunity to strategically reach out to different groups of people within their CoP, and engage in information exchange and communication. Using a content analysis method, we investigate two intermediate information mechanisms (information richness and informal communication) that social media KMDGs are theorized to generate, and quantify their effects on labor productivity and return on assets. Our findings provide evidence of KMDG positively affecting organizational performance through embedded information and social communication. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Translating the impact of knowledge management processes into knowledge-based innovation: The neglected and mediating role of knowledge-worker productivity
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85034439291&doi=10.1016%2fj.jbusres.2017.11.001&partnerID=40&md5=ca0154af71614441b3551b7ca59e4797
ABSTRACT: This study proposes a novel research model to investigate the neglected and pivotal mediating role of knowledge-worker productivity between knowledge management processes (knowledge generation, knowledge sharing, and knowledge application) and innovation. The data were collected from the 369 knowledge workers in the IT sector of Pakistan and analyzed using the SmartPLS 3 Version 26. The results indicate that knowledge-worker productivity mediates between two knowledge management processes (knowledge creation and knowledge utilization) and innovation. However, surprisingly, it does not mediate between knowledge sharing and innovation. The results support the pivotal role of knowledge-worker productivity-the most striking challenge for the management discipline in the 21st century-in knowledge-based innovation. Moreover, the results signify the overarching role of the human and cultural approach to knowledge management over the Big Data and IT and system-based approaches. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Despite the increasing pace of digital transformation initiatives across many industry verticals, lack of understanding among business leadership is cited as one of the major barriers for successful implementation of business transformation. This article explores the imperatives of business models and digital transformation from practical perspective and proposes an improvised business model framework with particular focus on digital services providers. Extant literature covering the trends of business models and digital transformation were reviewed qualitatively along with select reports pertaining to challenges faced by communications service providers. Key findings of this article suggest, a practical framework and business model representation to mitigate the challenges of business models and digital transformation. The authors believe, such an approach shall open up new and innovative opportunities for communication service providers to become true digital service providers which will help their business customers to plan and empirically progress with their business transformation efforts. © 2019, IGI Global.

Knowledge management processes and sustainable competitive advantage: An empirical examination in private universities
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85042193253&doi=10.1016%2fj.jbusres.2018.02.013&partnerID=40&md5=5a7f6fc70a73b212e0ef913007c52243
ABSTRACT: In modern times, it has come to the realization of organizations that acquiring knowledge and using it in an effective manner is the only way to have a sustainable competitive advantage (SCA) in the marketplace. This means that the resources of an organization must include knowledge, which should always be cared for and developed upon. When it comes to private colleges and universities, these are really just investments for the future businesspeople of the world. Through knowledge management processes (KMP), the knowledge they end up processing from these educational institutions will help them decide the direction in which they go in the future and how competitive they will be in the business world. But when it comes to knowledge-based view (KBV) and resource-based view (RBV), there is no clear explanation between them and how much the competitive advantage that KMP provides can be sustained. In this study, we will look at how and why SCA can be created by KMP from the educational environment's KBV and RBV. In order to achieve the objective, a hypothesis was created along with a quantitative survey method of design. The initiation of the structural equation modelling (SEM) method helped determine the relationship between the study variables through deductive approach. The respondents of this study are comprised of 525 academic leaders with varying positions from 44 private Iraqi universities. The results show a significant relationship between KMP and SCA. To attain a better SCA, private universities must generate knowledge, store knowledge, share knowledge and apply knowledge that is backed by identify of knowledge and formulating of its goals throughout every aspect of the organization. The research adds to the active group of knowledge that is currently available in the area of strategic knowledge management. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: This article describes how in recent years, enterprises have increasingly adopted social technologies to support customer relationship management (CRM) practices. To increase CRM performance, enterprises have had to develop appropriate social CRM strategies in emerging social network applications. This article investigates the alignment between social network applications and the “4C strategy” as a social CRM strategy in organizations. It intends to understand how alignment influences CRM performance. A total of 225 Taiwanese companies, which have adopted Facebook to interact with customers, were surveyed. According to the results, alignment between the 4C strategy and social network applications has a positive and significant impact on CRM performance. The results also suggest that organizations require a high-level integration of social network applications with the 4C strategy to achieve high CRM performance. Copyright © 2019, IGI Global.

The article makes a contribution to the history of teacher education and how we theorise change in the field by providing an empirical description and analysis of one highly influential programme internationally and using the tools of CHAT to theorise innovation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Do incentives matter when working for god? The impact of performance-based financing on faith-based healthcare in Uganda
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85053846975&doi=10.1016%2fj.worlddev.2018.09.011&partnerID=40&md5=5f80c8b7fa3bc643c2c72cc35e59e3fb
ABSTRACT: Can extrinsic incentives motivate faith-based healthcare providers? This paper challenges the finding that religious providers are intrinsically motivated to serve (poor) patients, and that extrinsic incentives may crowd-out such motivation. We use a unique panel of output and expenditure data from small faith-based nonprofit healthcare facilities in Uganda to estimate the effect of introducing performance-based financing. The output of the observed facilities is less than 50% of their potential. Performance-based financing increases output and efficiency robustly by at least 27%, with no apparent reduction in the perceived quality of services. Religious nonprofit healthcare providers may well be intrinsically motivated, but respond positively to extrinsic incentives. Whether working for god or not, incentives matter. © 2018 The Author(s)

A Maturity model for hospital information systems

https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85038866073&doi=10.1016%2fj.jbusres.2017.12.012&partnerID=40&md5=4d734a2a38bf98f2f18e4a5bfd6f20b3
ABSTRACT: In the last five decades, maturity models have been introduced as guides and reference frameworks for information system (IS) management in organizations within different industries and sectors. In the healthcare domain, maturity models have also been used to address a wide variety of challenges, complexities and the high demand for hospital IS (HIS) implementations. The present paper describes a research project focused on the development of a comprehensive maturity model applied in the HIS context. The outcome of this research is the HIS maturity model (hereafter referred to as HISMM), which includes six stages of HIS growth and maturity progression. The HISMM has the peculiarity of congregating a set of key maturity-influencing factors and respective characteristics, enabling not only the assessment of the global maturity of a HIS, but also the individual maturity of its different dimensions. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: In accordance with the resource-based view (RBV) and human capital resources literatures, we investigate positive outcomes derived from human capital development programs (HCDP). We theorize that superior HCDP represent competitive advantage that improves operational performance and subsequently leads to positive financial outcomes. Data from 2003 to 2011, including 30 organizations from Major League Baseball (as well as their subsidiaries), were analyzed using regression models to examine how HCDP affect financial performance through operational performance. The findings support our hypotheses: Better HCDP lead to operational performance, which leads to greater revenue and sales. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

IT application maturity, management institutional capability and process management capability
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055860156&doi=10.4018%2fJOEUC.2019010104&partnerID=40&md5=bb15715763d71ad543ca347779944fee
ABSTRACT: This article studies the influence of enterprise core competence on IT application maturity (ITAM) from the perspectives of management institutional and process management capabilities. The roles of firm ownership and international organization of standard (ISO) certifications are also studied. Based on reliable and valid measurements of IT applications maturity, management institutional capability, and process management capability, the authors collect corresponding data from 123 companies in China. They find a positive relationship between capabilities and ITAM. Management institutional capability has a stronger relationship with ITAM in Chinese state-owned enterprises or public companies; while multinational companies or joint ventures witness a stronger relationship with process management capability. ISO helps companies with low management institutional capability to improve ITAM. However, for companies with higher management institutional capability, ISO mitigates the relationship and poses a shift of the importance to process management capability in improving ITAM. © 2019, IGI Global.

. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85046806660&doi=10.1016%2fj.jbusres.2018.04.011&partnerID=40&md5=3147975ac3ea9bd4ed473156eb761198
ABSTRACT: Online Recruitment (OR) is a growing trend. It takes place online, using tools that enable the receipt of applications, the search for professionals, a quick triage and provision of feedback to applicants. This exploratory research aims to describe perceptions of this tool, gathering data from potential job candidates and personnel stakeholders. Data was gathered using a survey and interviews. Results show that 46% of participants had already used OR and that for 42% of the applicants it took less than a week to receive feedback from the recruiting organization. Qualitative data suggests a dominant positive appraisal of this type of recruitment. It is considered a fast method and is able to reach a wide audience. However, it is impersonal and there are doubts regarding the control over the process and the veracity of the job ads. Organizations should consider the perceptions of different stakeholders in order to optimize the process of OR. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

Combining knowledge stock and knowledge flow to generate superior incremental innovation performance — Evidence from Swiss manufacturing
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85026840129&doi=10.1016%2fj.jbusres.2017.04.003&partnerID=40&md5=07e9d4db850b2ecc6570b004d0ea9ea0
ABSTRACT: Firms generate new knowledge that leads to innovations by recombining existing knowledge sources. A successful recombination depends on the availability of a knowledge stock (human capital pool) and the flow of knowledge within the firm (induced by HRM systems). While human resource theory expects complementarities between human capital pools and HRM systems, it does not explicitly address how knowledge exchange may be guaranteed or fostered. Moreover, empirical approaches neglect the complexity of such complementarities. In this study we develop a model that integrates a firm's knowledge stock and flow into a knowledge creation (KC) system comprising four ideal types. This system explains the occurrence of superior incremental innovation performance. We empirically analyze the KC system by applying fuzzy set qualitative comparative analysis (fsQCA) and identify configurations concurring with our ideal types. The results show that the use of human capital and HRM practices depends on firm size and industry dynamism. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

The establishment of collaboration in managing information security through multisourcing
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055096732&doi=10.1016%2fj.cose.2018.10.005&partnerID=40&md5=bf5acc926e3cc9428d4b0cbe0b06cad5
ABSTRACT: Purpose: As information security requirements evolve due to ever-changing business and regulatory requirements, and threat landscape, organisations have turned to multisourcing as a method of delivering information security services. This development has created opportunities for service providers which specialise in information security service provision to collaborate and deliver security services through multisourcing contracts. Therefore the research develops a collaboration framework for managing information security through multisourcing. Methodology: This paper explores collaboration in multisourcing information security contracts through a qualitative case study that investigated the phenomenon from the views and experiences of a client organisation and its six service providers. Findings: The research found that multisourcing contracts can effectively manage information security services through collaborative efforts from multiple service providers and technology vendors. Practical implications: Theoretical insights into the use of collaboration and partnerships in the multisourcing of information security are non-existent. Therefore, the research contributes to practice by introducing a tripartite collaboration framework for multisourcing information security. This tripartite collaboration consists of client, service provider and technology vendors. Originality value: The research demonstrates through the perspective of client organisation and service providers that collaboration in multisourcing information security contracts goes beyond the client and its service providers to include even technology vendors. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

How resilient is the Torres Strait Treaty (Australia and Papua New Guinea) to global change? A fisheries governance perspective
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055499187&doi=10.1016%2fj.envsci.2018.10.005&partnerID=40&md5=fc455f59c1aa157dd19562651eee8f02
ABSTRACT: Multi-lateral treaties are the primary institutional instrument for managing shared trans-national ecosystems, but their original designs may not be resilient to unanticipated global pressures. Here we evaluate the Torres Strait Treaty, which was ratified in 1985 to manage marine resources shared by Traditional Inhabitants from Western Province, Papua New Guinea (PNG) and the Torres Strait Islands of Australia. Since 1985 rapid Asian economic growth has driven illegal fishing and trading practices amongst PNG fishers, and impacts from mining on PNG coastal settlements, exacerbated by relatively limited management capacity on the PNG side of the border. We evaluate the resilience of the Treaty to these unprecedented pressures by applying six design principles from the literature on resilient trans-boundary river basin treaties. Our analysis indicates that the Treaty's strengths lie in delegated inter-governmental organizations, conflict resolution and resource allocation mechanisms that account for variability. However, its weaknesses are due to the lack of formal review mechanisms, the absence of joint monitoring of potentially over-exploited species (sharks, barramundi, jewfish, mud crabs and reef fish), and low PNG capacity for enforcement. We present a ‘score-card’ synthesising our evaluation, and recommend adaptive co-management processes that will enhance the resilience of the Treaty, including the regular review of the Treaty's structure and terms, and inclusion of external stakeholders related to cross-border trade with neighboring Indonesia, and PNG mining. We discuss the relevance of our approach for the design and evaluation of multi-lateral marine resource-sharing agreements, and regional security. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Web-based learning and development of university's electronic informational educational environment

ABSTRACT: Web-based learning has been developed by the majority of academic institutions and organizations worldwide due to its obvious benefits for both educators and learners. Meanwhile, many of the existing developmental approaches in this sphere lack one crucial consideration necessary for implementing web-based learning at academic institutions. In this article, the authors identify two processes: development of distance learning and digitalization of training that are represented now at almost every academic university. The article singles out the stages of their development and shows that the processes lead to the same result - a new quality of education. The authors focus on figuring out which path is more effective for achieving the highest level of development depending on university's characteristics. Accumulation of detailed information in the Electronic informational educational environment about current learning outcomes creates opportunities for emerging trends, such as Learning Analytics, Personalized Learning and Adaptive Learning.

SOA adoption factors in e-banking: An empirical analysis from the practical perspective
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055895690&doi=10.4018%2fIJISSS.2019010102&partnerID=40&md5=d008657039a1356d10895199f73550ff
ABSTRACT: Nowadays a lack of integration among software services and databases has become a major IT problem in many organizations including banking industries. Service oriented architecture (SOA) is the most recent and comprehensive method among the different methods and technologies proposed for integrity implementation. One of the main reasons for banks' failure in achieving the benefits of SOA is lack of a framework that includes all critical factors in SOA adoption. The aim of this article is to identify and analyze the influential factors (organizational, technical, environmental and human) on SOA adoption in e-banking and providing a comprehensive framework that explains these factors. Such a framework enhances the decision-making and enables banks to achieve the benefits of SOA. In order to gather operational data, questionnaire and interview had been used. The conceptual framework was investigated using Smart PLS and SPSS software. The empirical data investigation and interpretation shows that: organizational, technical, human and environmental factors are crucial for SOA adoption. © 2019, IGI Global.

Protective measures and security policy non-compliance intention: IT vision conflict as a moderator
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055860199&doi=10.4018%2fJOEUC.2019010101&partnerID=40&md5=c948c18cca6df6268593feaef4808998
ABSTRACT: Internal vulnerabilities and insider threats top the list of information security (InfoSec) incidents; prompting organizations to establish InfoSec policy (ISP). Yet, mitigating user's ISP non-compliance is still an arduous task. Hence, this study aims to minimize user's ISP non-compliance intention by investigating their perception and attitude toward ISP non-compliance. Specifically, protective measures drawing upon the protection motivation theory - perceived severity of ISP non-compliance, rewards and familiarity with ISP - analyze users' attitude toward ISP non-compliance. Further, the new construct, information technology (IT) vision conflict, is the mismatch between the values that users hold and those embedded in the ISP. The misalignment of the two conflicting values moderates the relationship between the protective measures and attitude toward ISP non-compliance. Findings show that IT vision conflict weakens the negative relationship between perceived severity of ISP non-compliance and attitude toward ISP non-compliance; indirectly affecting ISP non-compliance intention. © 2019, IGI Global.

The viable system model for diagnosing and handling IT-project interdependencies in large portfolios
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054314932&doi=10.4018%2fIJITPM.2019010105&partnerID=40&md5=ab3630a455fb191a0b62020ffc390e0f
ABSTRACT: Adequately considering project interdependencies has shown to be a determinant of how successful IT/IS project portfolios are managed. However, this can be especially troublesome since there is no universal way to handle many project interdependencies that continue to change over time due to environmental uncertainty or unexpected decisions. This can seriously disrupt portfolio performance. In this article, the authors used the systems perspective to address the problem of managing multiple IT-project interdependencies in complex IT/IS portfolio environment. In particular, the authors propose using the cybernetic model Viable System Model to facilitate thinking and reasoning concerning the difficulty of managing IT-project interdependencies. To validate their approach and to ensure the appropriateness of it, the authors used real-world problem situations drawn from multiple case studies conducted in four leading organizations in Saudi Arabia. The findings support that the Viable System Model can be applied to assist in diagnosing and handling of IT-project interdependencies. Copyright © 2019, IGI Global.

Critical impact of organizational and individual inertia in explaining non-compliant security behavior in the Shadow IT context
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054912213&doi=10.1016%2fj.cose.2018.09.012&partnerID=40&md5=2b5aedb3760476f7460671164184ad6b
ABSTRACT: Shadow IT refers to the use of information technology (IT) solutions and systems without prior explicit organizational approval. In this research, we have investigated an important role of organizational and individual inertia in explaining non-compliant security behavior in the Shadow IT context. Using the theory of organizational and individual inertia and status quo framework as theoretical lenses, we sought to explain the factors that form an individual's cognitive based inertia. Our study offers important insights into how inertia shapes and drives cognitive based inertia, which drives the behavioral intention to continue using Shadow IT. We suggest several new insights for theory and practitioners on how to better address the Shadow IT phenomenon with the objective that organizations are more agile, productive and efficient but at the same time, more compliant with information security policy requirements. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Investigating the mediating role of social networking service usage on the big five personality traits and on the job satisfaction of Korean workers
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055888632&doi=10.4018%2fJOEUC.2019010106&partnerID=40&md5=7b89c12caaecc302ce85b67efab51951
ABSTRACT: This study examines how the Big Five personality traits and the use of social networking services (SNSs) promote job satisfaction among Korean workers. The study sample is drawn from the Korean Education & Employment Panel (KEEP) for 2011, which gathers comprehensive data on Koreans' individual demographics, including information regarding their education, families, and work and personal lives. Structural equation modeling is employed to examine the mediation model between Big-Five personality and job satisfaction of workers. From a sample of 1,646 workers employed in Korean workplaces, the authors found that the Big Five personality traits were significantly related to SNS usage and job satisfaction. SNS usage was found to be a factor in determining job satisfaction, and SNS usage partially mediated the relationship between personality (extroversion and neuroticism) and job satisfaction. To improve employees' work-related attitudes, organizations must recognize the growing influence of SNS usage on those workplace attitudes. © 2019, IGI Global.

Incorporating a gender approach in the hospitality industry: Female executives’ perceptions
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047074353&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijhm.2018.05.008&partnerID=40&md5=be3799c5f36f43fbe1dfed73566c48a6
ABSTRACT: Despite the increasing presence of women in the hospitality labour market, empirical evidence shows persistent horizontal and vertical segregation, as well as a pay gap - a situation that perpetuates lost opportunities for the industry. Based on Barbara Risman's model “Gender as a Social Structure” as a leading reference, the paper provides a gender based approach for the hospitality industry. Risman's three levels of analysis (Individual, Interactional and Institutional) are completed with an Intersectional level, conforming the “Gender as a Social Structure in the Hospitality Industry” model. This model aims at identifying factors that cause discrimination among female executives. The methodology is based on thirty semi-structured in-depth interviews with female executives in the Spanish hospitality industry. The results show that the influence of self-imposed barriers, gender roles, problems associated with work-life conciliation and issues related to gendered organizations are the main factors that hinder achieving gender equality. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Effective principles of informal online learning design: A theory-building metasynthesis of qualitative research
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054379365&doi=10.1016%2fj.compedu.2018.09.026&partnerID=40&md5=8d8821775a88618bb9c361450d39144b
ABSTRACT: Informal online learning is the unstructured learning that happens in daily life while people are accessing the internet. Research on the use and design of interactive Web 2.0 platforms for informal learning is minimal, and often platform-specific. This theory-building metasynthesis aims to identify what is known about how informal online learning can be effectively designed outside a formal online course structure. The study reviewed 22 articles that investigated learning that happened primarily online, was self-directed in nature, and had a primarily adult audience. The author brought together the findings of these individual studies to identified two effective principles of informal online learning design that research dissemination organizations can utilize when developing online outreach education programs for adult audiences: (a) interaction opportunities support knowledge construction and learner empowerment; and (b) segmented, titled, and tagged learning objects facilitate personalized learning. The principles identified in this study not only describe what is known about how adults learn informally online, but also provide the common language and goals to frame the interdisciplinary collaboration likely necessary to employ them. © 2018

Customer incivility and employees’ outcomes in the hotel: Testing the mediating role of emotional exhaustion
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055046353&doi=10.1016%2fj.tmp.2018.10.004&partnerID=40&md5=0dd681fe16a1f23d8b5d1b0e3d65fca7
ABSTRACT: A logical position emphasized by the service-oriented organizations that ‘the customer is always right’ and the organizational policies that requires employees to make customer happy, even in situations involving customer uncivil behavior has continued to be one of the antecedents of employees’ negative outcomes. Applying the conservation of resources theory (COR), the current study develops and tests a research model that investigates the relationships between customer incivility (CIVT), emotional exhaustion (EEXT), turnover intentions (TINT) and job satisfaction (JSAT). A total of 328 customer-contact employees in 4 and 5 star hotels in Nigeria participated. Using structural equation modeling, the findings demonstrate that CIVT increases EEXT and TINT, but has no direct influence on JSAT. The findings demonstrate that EEXT partially mediates the effect of CIVT on TINT while it fully mediates the effect of CIVT on JSAT. Implications of the findings for the literature and limitation are discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Small accommodation business growth in rural areas: Effects on guest experience and financial performance
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85045546108&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijhm.2018.03.016&partnerID=40&md5=f38419f40fa948026ae109cbb2671a94
ABSTRACT: Rural tourism development features growth of small accommodation businesses (SABs). The disparity between the applause that appreciates increased economic benefits from SAB development, and the criticism on its potential damage to rural tourism experience, makes it necessary to verify the exact consequences of SAB growth. Drawing on business growth theory, this study models, tests and compares the effects of SAB size on various guest experiences and financial performance in the context of a highly dynamic rural destination, the north of China's Zhejiang Province. Data was collected from 188 SABs and 873 guests, and analyzed through hierarchical linear modelling and multiple linear regression. The result points to a trade-off faced by entrepreneurs between enhancing guest experience and achieving economic goals as SAB size increases. Implications of the study for research and practice are also discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Life cycle energy assessment of a typical marble processing plant
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054295360&doi=10.4018%2fIJSESD.2019010103&partnerID=40&md5=0c9efa3f7f9d5aefb06eb86cf8503ed0
ABSTRACT: This article describes how marble is one of the most important stone resources in terms of durability. It is aesthetically pleasing, and a decorative material used by many architects, as well as plays an important role in the economy of India. Most of the marble processing activities are performed by small and medium scale industries (SMEs) not only in India but worldwide. These industries have low efficiency and productivity due to lack of new technologies, high productivity cost and a lack of proper sustainable waste management systems, thereby increasing the waste generated during the processing stage. There is a significant need within the sector for increasing production efficiency, combined with the need of a substantial reduction in waste generated that can be achieved by endorsing technological innovations. This is in addition to following best available processing practices, incorporating energy saving technologies and modernizing the sectors management and organization structure which will substantially increase efficiency as well as production. This article provides a systematic approach for assessing the current energy and present environment status of a typical SME processing units of Rajasthan area, and proposes measures for meeting cleaner production principles. An evaluation methodology was developed considering the realistic plant operation scenarios. The total energy inputs for processing the products with their appropriate environmental indices like CO2 emissions were calculated. Alternatively, the CO2 emissions were also calculated by Gabi educational software for different industries and the best way of reducing the energy consumption is suggested by following alternate source of energy.

Going downstream in a project-based firm: Integration of distributors in the delivery of complex systems
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055747683&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijproman.2018.09.007&partnerID=40&md5=6d116b24e954aff583216671e023ddaf
ABSTRACT: Research on the integration of different actors in project business has centered on the upstream value chain and a project-based firm's relationship with suppliers. The downstream delivery chain also includes an integration challenge as some project-based firms use distributors to sell and deliver systems. The purpose of this paper is to highlight the importance of integrating with distributors in the delivery of complex systems. A qualitative case study was conducted in one project-based firm. Different distributor capabilities were identified and grouped into business, relational, marketing, and delivery capabilities. Different integration mechanisms were mapped at business and project levels, and divided into control-, cooperation-, and development-oriented mechanisms. The findings show that distributor capabilities related to complex system delivery develop through repetitive collaboration across projects. The stable position of distributors in the downstream value chain facilitate the use of integration mechanisms at the business level and development-oriented integration approach at the project level. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd and Association for Project Management and the International Project Management Association

An event-based data warehouse to support decisions in multi-channel, multi-service contact centers
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055884414&doi=10.4018%2fJCIT.2019010103&partnerID=40&md5=f77e867fc8989eaf5a0974486e98cb64
ABSTRACT: Multi-channel contact centers are an increasingly important component of today's business world. They serve as a primary customer-facing channel for firms in many different industries, and employ millions of operators across the globe. During their operation, they generate vast amounts of data, ranging from automatically registered logs to handwritten notes and voice recordings. Unfortunately, in most firms, data of interest is unstructured, and stored in several databases, making their exploitation very hard. This article presents a decision support system for a multi-channel, multi-service contact center for front office business process outsourcing, along with its prospective extension to a decision management system. Its core is an enterprise-wide data warehouse, based on the general concept of an event. The proposed system supports a broad new set of advanced analysis tasks, ranging from operator performance assessment to call-flow simulation and data mining, providing operational and management staff the basis for taking effective operative and strategic decisions. © 2019, IGI Global.

Unabsorbed slack resource deployment and exploratory and exploitative innovation: How much does CEO expertise matter?
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054039019&doi=10.1016%2fj.jbusres.2018.08.023&partnerID=40&md5=24d6ed91cb74866025de246bcdf264e9
ABSTRACT: Unabsorbed slack resources are critical for organizational innovativeness and success but research regarding the relationship between unabsorbed slack and firm outcomes has resulted in mixed findings. We build on upper echelons theory to shed light on the mostly overlooked role of decision makers in slack resource deployment. We investigate how the CEO's expertise influences slack resource deployment in computer software firms' exploratory and exploitative activities. Using panel data, our findings show that unabsorbed slack is associated with an increased share of exploration and a decreased share of exploitation in firm's activities. These relationships are weakened in firms led by CEOs with longer firm tenure or wider functional background breadth. In the case of CEOs with technical education, the negative relationship between slack and exploitation becomes positive, while the link between slack and exploration becomes negative. Additionally, our post-hoc analysis reveals a more precise non-linear account of the main effect relationships. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The advent of customer experiential knowledge management approach (CEKM): The integration of offline & online experiential knowledge
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047639575&doi=10.1016%2fj.jbusres.2018.05.029&partnerID=40&md5=ba1c9ff0f9451a382b1a0894b00a66fd
ABSTRACT: This paper builds a conceptual reflection leading to the proposition of the customer experiential knowledge management (CEKM) approach. The challenge, here, is how to connect the customer knowledge management to the customer lived service experience. Hence, a conceptual analysis ascertains that the customer knowledge, as retrieved from his lived experience, plays a key role in the implementation of an experiential innovation. In this regard, the customer experiential knowledge is drawn from the lived service experience in situ, both online and offline. The customer experiential knowledge is redefined by integrating the experience lived and shared online. Then, a strategic model of CEKM, that integrates the customer experience processed through the knowledge management, is proposed. Research gaps are highlighted through a critical review of the literature in order to defend CEKM approach and give way to the proposition of practical implications in terms of competencies and research questions. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Fab Labs are places of learning through the exchange of knowledge among its members. They allow to leverage innovation using technological resources available in the space, stimulating the creativity of its participants and enabling the development of products and solutions based on personal projects from ideation, or the construction supported on knowledge developed by other elements collaboratively, enhancing the result. It'll be described how users learn with others in Fab Labs, which are laboratories of digital fabrication, serving as prototyping platforms of physical objects, with broad educational, social and economic advantages. Its users can leverage their imagination and develop sustainable, social, local, economic innovative solutions to solve real problems, supported by tacit and explicit knowledge transfer. Seven semi structured interviews were performed with the Fab Managers of one Portuguese Lab, one Spanish Lab, one French Lab, one Italian Lab, and three Brazilian Labs. Interesting findings characterized the researched environments. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

The changing paradigm of health and mobile phones: An innovation in the health care system
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054296972&doi=10.4018%2fJGIM.2019010102&partnerID=40&md5=fe552d96dd72640710f0534551e12e4b
ABSTRACT: This article describes how widespread adoption of mobile technology in healthcare is an innovation that is inevitable today in both developed and emerging markets around the world. Mobile health services (m-Health) act as an effective, accessible and affordable means of providing healthcare knowledge to users directly from providers. Despite such benefits of m-Health services, rapid adoption is not yet occurring, particularly in emerging markets. The main barrier is mostly the cynical behavior of users regarding this medium of healthcare services. The aim of this article is to examine underlying factors that can influence future use intentions of m-Health services. Conceptual model of the study identifies service qualities like reliability, privacy, responsiveness, empathy and information quality along with facilitating conditions, trust, effort expectancy and performance expectancy as significant constructs that influences users' overall perceptions of m-Health services, along with moderating effects of age and gender. Limitations and implications for practice and research are also discussed. Copyright © 2019, IGI Global.

Visual analytics adoption in business enterprises: An integrated model of technology acceptance and task-technology fit
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055896256&doi=10.4018%2fIJISSS.2019010105&partnerID=40&md5=1a57e34ee931f373ed3d366eb6534b2f
ABSTRACT: Visual analytics is increasingly being recognized as a source of competitive advantage. Yet, limited research has examined the factors deriving it organizational adoption. By integrating the technology acceptance model (TAM) with the task-technology fit (TTF) model, this research developed a model for visual analytics adoption in business enterprises. To test the research model, data was collected through a questionnaire survey distributed to 400 business professionals working in a variety of industries in Jordan. Collected data were tested and analyzed using structural equation modeling (SEM) technique. Findings of this research confirmed the applicability of the integrated TAM/TTF model to explain the key factors that affect the adoption of visual analytics systems for work-related tasks. Specifically, the results of this research demonstrated that the task, technology, and user characteristics are fundamental and influential antecedents of TTF, which in turn has a significant positive effect on the perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use of visual analytics systems. Additionally, there are significant positive effects from perceived usefulness and perceived ease of use toward users' intention to adopt visual analytics systems, and a firm relationship between perceived ease of use and perceived usefulness of visual analytics systems. Together all these constructs explain 59.9% of the variance in user's intention to adopt visual analytics systems at the workplace. Findings of this research provide several important implications for research and practice, and thus should help in the design and development of more user-accepted visual analytics systems and applications. © 2019, IGI Global.

Knowledge management practice system: Theorising from an international meta-standard
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85034839448&doi=10.1016%2fj.jbusres.2017.11.022&partnerID=40&md5=af3090146b7cbba9872e42168abfad3c
ABSTRACT: The emergence of a new international knowledge management (KM) standard reflects convergence in KM practice. The aim of this study is to theorise KM from the new standard, by addressing the following research questions: what are the important themes of the standard; and what are the key mechanisms and how do they explain KM practice system from a theoretical perspective? This paper adopts a sensegiving reflective insider account using practice theory as a lens and social mechanisms as a method in theorising KM practice system. This study makes three contributions. Firstly, the paper identifies four themes from the KM standard: context-driven, performance-led, enabler-savvy and sustainably-supported. Secondly, three mechanisms emerge that robustly ‘explains’ KM practice system: learning and knowledge creation culture; organizational knowledge architecture for adaptive and exaptive capacity; and ‘business model’ for knowledge capitalisation and value capture. Thirdly, a new theoretical framework of KM practice system is developed. © 2017 Elsevier Inc.

One-dimensional times: a dialectical response to the Irish Times’ coverage of the global financial crisis
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84978471508&doi=10.1080%2f14759551.2016.1208657&partnerID=40&md5=247f500aa3287693d92dc6aad77830c5
ABSTRACT: A growing literature claims that critique of neoliberal capitalism after the global financial crisis (GFC) has been ‘captured’ within the logic of capital. Such research argues that ‘capture’ is achieved through a process whereby critique of neoliberalism is transformed into arguments for more neoliberalism. This creates a one-dimensional ‘recovery’ discourse. Drawing on Marcuse’s theory outlining ‘one-dimensional society’ and critical discourse analysis, this study assesses the relevancy of such claims for an Irish medium, the Irish Times, through an examination of GFC-related discourse during 2009–2010. This study finds that economic discourse in the Irish Times is captured when organisational bias allows pro-neoliberal actors from business and government privileged access to discourse production. We engage a call from organisation studies for a dialectical reading of captured discourse. We end with a discussion of the limits of this reflexive approach to capitalism’s contradictions for disrupting its ongoing hegemony. © 2016, © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

Supercomputers to improve the performance in higher education: A review of the literature
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054803662&doi=10.1016%2fj.compedu.2018.10.004&partnerID=40&md5=38186fef21bb37c132e29af1d4fb7974
ABSTRACT: The use of Supercomputers is currently very widespread, constituting an essential component in many fields of science. The interest in the use of high performance computation is increasing in a wider and more diverse population of higher education students, mainly senior undergraduates and postgraduates, because the use of these infrastructures allows learners to improve their skills and the results of their training. For this reason, the demand of courses related to supercomputing increases continuously. In this paper we propose, through a wide review of primary studies, several questions that have been considered as a way of knowing the most widely-used contents in Supercomputing training. We have focused on the factors considered for improving training in Supercomputing, in order to improve the results of researchers in higher education organizations, to identify the limitations of Supercomputing training, and to provide solutions for these limitations. During the search procedure for answering research questions, 1911 studies were considered in the first selection. Through the definition of inclusion and exclusion codes in the results of searching databases, 136 published articles were studied. Finally, using quality criteria, 34 studies were identified as relevant in answering the research questions. Several factors were described, such as the way in which courses related to Supercomputing are organized, the adaptations that are currently being applied in curricula related to the students of these techniques, the use of problem-solving training and the qualification of teachers, among the most relevant ones, as well as several limitations of this type of training and the identification of solutions for these limitations. Data was collected by searching keywords related to Supercomputing training and education in the most important databases used in Computational Science, finding empirical evidence to support the positive effect of High Performance Computers (HPC) on educators and researchers. The implications of this study are: first, it provides a summary of the most relevant factors in improving training, as well as the factors that improve the results through the use of a Supercomputer; and second, it provides the analysis of the limitations found for a better performance of learners and the solutions for these limitations. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Evaluating the explanatory power of theoretical frameworks on intention to comply with information security policies in higher education
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055051315&doi=10.1016%2fj.cose.2018.09.016&partnerID=40&md5=cf4ed83742a380ddd214cadc66e79557
ABSTRACT: Higher education institutions have invested heavily in their high-tech infrastructure to ensure the security and integrity of their information. Incompliance with information technology policies has shown to lead to mass information leaks, reputational damage and potential litigation. Little research has been conducted on the subject of employees’ compliance with such sensitive protocols. This paper presents a comprehensive theoretical model based on Theory of Planned Behavior, Protection Motivation Theory, General Deterrence Theory and Organizational Theory for predicting intentions of higher education employees’ compliance with information security policies. Utilizing a survey instrument and using Structural Equation Modeling-Partial Least Squares method, this study found that perceived vulnerability, response efficacy and response cost to be the most predictive indicators that are positively associated with intentions of information security compliance among university staff and faculty. But, little support was found for the General Deterrence Theory, Theory of Planned Behavior and Organizational Theory in explaining the variance of higher education staff intentions to comply with information security policies. Results indicated that the Protection Motivation Theory provides the best theoretical framework to understand higher education employees’ behavior with respect to compliance with information security. Such results confirmed earlier empirical investigations attempting to understand the basic question of why do employees differ with respect to compliance with information security. Consistent with the prior research, severe sanctions, close management supervision, peers’ pressure and attitudes towards information security do not matter as much as perceived vulnerability and response efficacy in ensuring higher levels of intentions to comply with ISPs in organizations. The study recommends universities and colleges to invest in applied information security training for their staff, as well as for the university overall community. © 2018

Met4ITIL: A process management and simulation-based method for implementing ITIL
.

ABSTRACT: A key requirement for service providers is to define, manage and deliver Information Technology (IT) services to effectively support business goals and customer needs. Several process reference models for the IT service management (ITSM) have emerged, being Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) the reference model accepted as de facto standard for ITSM. This paper introduces a novel method for implementing ITIL which is based on business process management lifecycle and simulation modeling. An application of the method to implement the incident management process in a Spanish company is also presented. The method has been reviewed by ITIL experts and evaluated from the process stakeholders’ perspective using a questionnaire. The answers provided to the questionnaire show the usefulness of the method to address critical success factors and to support the application of adequate process management practices. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

From goods-service logic to a memory-dominant logic: Business logic evolution and application in hospitality
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047274660&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijhm.2018.05.014&partnerID=40&md5=ba3ce340138168a13f63e0e1c8f3394a
ABSTRACT: Earlier theories of business logics represent a shift in the value creation mindset. This study proposes a framework related to the applicability within the context of hospitality and advocates advancing the existing logic beyond value-in-use or experience to value-in-memory as a firm strategy described as memory-dominant logic (MDL). The proposed framework indicates that the range of business logic constructs represent complementary and contrasting aspects and that their applicability are likely to be dependent on the institutional context, market environment and target market characteristics. The framework uses an adapted model of experiential learning and support from the tourism, hospitality, psychology, marketing and service literatures. The MDL proposition reaffirms the evolution of value creation and underscores the potential value for the firm as well as challenges. Future research, a model of the proposed mediating and moderating relationships and practical illustrations are provided. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Guests’ perceptions of emotionally expressive and non-expressive service providers within the hospitality context
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047063753&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijhm.2018.05.005&partnerID=40&md5=5fc7981a7a2d06f7b26f89f305e7631d
ABSTRACT: Emotions produce outward cues, such as facial expressions, that regulate our social lives, and these visible signals are generally interpreted by perceivers as valuable information. Service providers are often called on by their organisations to display emotions publicly within the organisation's accepted levels. Nonetheless, because of personal and cultural factors, guests may misinterpret, condemn or discard certain displays coming from others, such as employees and hosts. By allowing guests to share narratives of their own personal experiences, this study explores how receivers perceive expressions of emotion from service providers within the hospitality context. Our findings from informal interviews with hospitality receivers yield both theoretical and managerial implications. These advance our understanding of how people perceive the emotional expressions of others within a field that supposedly promotes intense human transactions and fosters relations between hosts and guests. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Teachers’ dual commitment to the organization and occupation: A person-centered investigation
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054097234&doi=10.1016%2fj.tate.2018.09.009&partnerID=40&md5=e80bec1e1cb075211b18a25b594d7d76
ABSTRACT: This study extends previous commitment research by applying person-centered analytic techniques to identify and compare profiles of affective, normative, and continuance commitment to the organization and occupation. Latent profile analyses applied to data from 336 Canadian teachers revealed five profiles with unique combinations of the three commitment mindsets across the two targets. Differences observed across profiles in teachers’ turnover intention and physical and psychological well-being are used to illustrate the benefits of taking a more holistic approach to the investigation of commitment compared to analyses involving individual targets and/or mindsets. Implications for commitment theory, future research, and practice are discussed. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

How uncivil customers corrode the relationship between frontline employees and retailers
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054292109&doi=10.1016%2fj.jretconser.2018.09.012&partnerID=40&md5=7ca444b26b2cb08b244ec54be89f3178
ABSTRACT: This study investigates the effects of customers’ uncivil treatments on frontline retail employees’ emotions, deviant behaviors and relationship with the retail organization. Our theoretical model is based on both marketing and personnel management literatures. 415 frontline retailing American employees answered our questionnaire. Employees treated uncivilly by customers feel angry but have to hide their negative emotions, which leads them to emotional exhaustion and deviant behaviors. Paradoxically, employees’ strong commitment to their retailing organization brings about more deviant behaviors. We propose some managerial strategies to cope with uncivil customers, as well as future research on this important and under-researched topic. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

HEART-IS: A novel technique for evaluating human error-related information security incidents
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054460114&doi=10.1016%2fj.cose.2018.09.002&partnerID=40&md5=c016a58e97452ff27befcb648cebc0c1
ABSTRACT: Organisations continue to suffer information security incidents and breaches as a result of human error even though humans are recognised as the weakest link with regard to information security. Despite this level of understanding organisations continue to focus their attention on technical security controls rather than the human factor and have not incorporated methods such as Human Reliability Analysis (HRA) which are used within high reliability sectors such as rail, aviation and energy. The objectives of our research are to define a human error related information security incident and create the novel HEART of Information Security (HEART-IS) technique which is an adaptation of the Human Error Assessment and Reduction Technique (HEART). We conducted a case study within a private sector organisation using HEART-IS to establish if HRA is applicable to information security. The novel HEART-IS technique comprises of a mapping component and an analysis component. In the case study, we applied HEART-IS to map HEART Error Producing Conditions (EPC) to twelve months of reported information security incidents and analysed the volumes of human error and underlying causes. We found that HEART-IS is applicable to the information security field with some minor amendments to the terminology. The mapping of information security incident causes to the HEART Error Producing Conditions (EPC) was successful but the in-built HEART human error probability calculations did not match the actual volumes of reported human error related incidents. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

An empirical study of gamification frameworks
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055875562&doi=10.4018%2fJOEUC.2019010102&partnerID=40&md5=7555ba9ac8750c55788ee261b3fd3cfa
ABSTRACT: Gamification is a relatively novel concept which is attracting interest from academics and practitioners as a method of mediating individual behaviour. It is increasingly being used in a wide range of social and business contexts across a range of diverse activities such as education, health care and personal productivity. In this article, the components used to implement gamification are catalogued. Using a standardised rubric, a sample of gamified activities is studied to measure the prevalence of the various components used to implement gamification. This research provides an empirically validated catalogue of specific components used to implement gamification, which can serve to guide the work of academics and practitioners. It demonstrates variance in the use of the different types of component, indicating that the utility of gamification components may differ. Finally, by contrasting the utilization of components in the individual and group contexts, this research identifies the contextual sensitivity of gamification. © 2019, IGI Global.

Measuring CRM effectiveness in Indian stock broking services

https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054299052&doi=10.4018%2fJGIM.2019010108&partnerID=40&md5=5a63d85f77e65b7d0502c8482b6bc624
ABSTRACT: The article tried to develop a multi-item scale for analyzing CRM effectiveness (CRME) from the customer perspective in the Indian stock broking context. The results revealed that customer satisfaction could be improved through to build customer trust and customer involvement substantially by focusing on the CRM system which further influences customer retention and ultimately, customer loyalty within stockbroking services. The findings of the article will help stockbrokers and their managers for a tactical decision making of CRM system implementation and practices for customer perspective. Despite the huge investment in CRM systems by the stockbrokers, critics have remained unconvinced about the effectiveness of CRM for meeting desired business outcomes. The reason being that broking firms often perceive CRM systems as a specific technology solution rather than integrating customer needs with the firm's strategy, people and business process which generates a parallel need to develop a scale to measures CRM effectiveness in Indian stock broking services from the customer perspective.

ABSTRACT: The last mile delivery is regarded as one of the most expensive but least efficient stretches in the business-to-customer supply chain. Designing the last mile delivery system in a lean way is crucial to serve customers efficiently and economically. To address this issue, we propose a bilevel multisized terminal location-routing problem (BL-MSTLRP) with simultaneous home delivery and customer's pickup services. The solution method is proposed by combining genetic algorithm (GA) and simulated annealing (SA), called self-adaptive SGA. Studies for designing the last mile delivery system in a real-world environment indicate the validity of the proposed model based on the comparison of different scenarios. Numerical experiments are also conducted to evaluate the performance of the presented SGA. Computational results show that the hybrid approach efficiently solves the BL-MSTLRP. © 2017 The Authors.

Revealing the black box of shifting from electronic commerce to mobile commerce: the case of Jordan
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050151494&doi=10.4067%2fS0718-18762019000100105&partnerID=40&md5=a72affb6c08139890fda748acf9edcc5
ABSTRACT: Mobile computing and the wireless web are likely to become the next major business models following the era of electronic commerce. In particular, rapid growth and the advancement in mobile technologies indicate that mobile commerce (m-commerce) will be the dominant business model in the future. In developing countries, services in mobile commerce are in a phase of rapid growth, yet the relevant research is limited. Thus, to increase the adoption of m-commerce among consumers in developing countries such as Jordan, the current study develops a model of consumers’ intentions to transfer from traditional (internet-based) e-commerce to m-commerce. The proposed model was empirically validated using a total of 451 paper-based questionnaires that were collected from undergraduate students at three private Jordanian universities. The reliability and validity of the structural model were evaluated by performing exploratory and confirmatory factor analyses, while the structural model was assessed by employing the structural equation modelling approach. The findings demonstrate that consumers’ intention to shift from traditional e-commerce to m-commerce can be explained by factors related to perceived differences in technology and value. The research model offers useful and insightful information to help practitioners and developers focus their efforts in designing and delivering effective m-commerce applications. © 2019 Universidad de Talca-Chile.

How to engineer gamification: The consensus, the best practice and the grey areas
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055866574&doi=10.4018%2fJOEUC.2019010103&partnerID=40&md5=4b9a89e02d537a2d739455325dfba86d
ABSTRACT: Gamification refers to the use of game elements in a business context to change users' behaviours, mainly increasing motivation towards a certain task or a strategic objective. Gamification has received a good deal of emphasis in both academia and industry across various disciplines and application areas. Despite the increasing interest, we still need a unified and holistic picture on how to engineer gamification, including the meaning of the term, its development process, the stakeholders and disciplines which need to be involved in it, and the concerns and risks that an ad-hoc design could raise for both businesses and users. To address this need, this article reports on empirical research which involved reviewing the literature and a range of gamification techniques and applications as secondary research, and an expert opinion study of two phases, qualitative and quantitative, as primary research. Based on the results, we provide a body of knowledge about gamification and point-out good practice principles and areas of gamification that are debatable and need further investigation. © 2019, IGI Global.

Megaprojects as organizational platforms and technology platforms for value creation
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055752525&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijproman.2018.10.001&partnerID=40&md5=3f35c684fc4490a0d5bd3230a8d7c01b
ABSTRACT: Megaprojects are multi-actor and multi-technology constellations that create value for society. Previous research on joint and coordinated activities to create value for multiple actors in megaprojects over system lifecycle is scarce. This study explores how the actors in a megaproject jointly create value. We analyze value creation in megaprojects by theorizing on the research on organizational platforms, which draws together knowledge from research on other types of platforms, ecosystems and networks. In our empirical study, we analyze a city district renewal megaproject, by focusing on the actors’ joint activities that contribute to synergetic project processes, solutions and outcomes both tangible and intangible that participating actors find beneficial. We derive five propositions that explain how actors in a megaproject create value through jointly planned and governed design principles, and through value-leveraging activities. Jointly planned and governed design principles include inter-organizational coordinating bodies and joint activities that share ownership and decision-making. In value-leveraging activities, leader actors facilitate megaproject actors’ competition and value capture that determine most suitable participants to value-creating activities. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd, APM and IPMA

The balanced scorecard of a new destination product: Implications for lodging and skiing firms
.

ABSTRACT: New product development (NPD) is a counter-seasonal strategy able to reduce demand fluctuations, especially during the seasonal tails. No previous study has analysed this field through the lens of balanced scorecard (BSC). This explorative paper contributes to this gap and considers two research questions: i) How is a destination NPD process operationalized using the four BSC perspectives? ii) What is the relevance and content of each perspective in this particular field? The study deploys a longitudinal analysis of the Skipassfree product, launched by Livigno (Italy) in 2007. Over a decade, this product generated a significant uplift both in terms of hotel guests (+108%) and ski company clients (+248%). The proposed framework is built around 22 codes and incorporates a fifth BSC perspective (the destination context). “Learning and growth” is the most significant perspective with “alignment” being a key attribute, which suggests the relevance of innovation and stakeholders’ involvement. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Build a people-oriented urbanization: China's new-type urbanization dream and Anhui model

https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054161839&doi=10.1016%2fj.landusepol.2018.09.031&partnerID=40&md5=0f0997c38ee5e42d0ee4fabb67f17dd9
ABSTRACT: Since 2014, the Chinese government has initiatednew-type urbanization under the guidance of ‘the National New-type Urbanization Plan (2014–2020)’, which embarks on a significant transformation of the model of urbanization in post-reform China. To understand the origin and outputs of this policy, this article demonstrates the context of China's new-type urbanization. The paper proposes a conceptual framework of new-type urbanization, which mainly includes four aspects: humanism, people-oriented urbanization; inclusivism, benefits sharing for urban and rural; sustainability, development without sacrifice of resources and environment; and harmonism, coordination. This is followed by an examination of the case of Anhui province, as a pilot province of China's new-type urbanization. Anhui has performed a lot of related work to promote citizenization of peasant workers and has made great progress on the reform of the household registration system. The study found that despite a special emphasis on people-oriented urbanization, the pressures and costs of citizenization of peasant workers are growing fast, accompanied by rising housing prices in cities. This insight suggests there are benefits and costs of promoting China's new-type urbanization. Despite the advantages of institutional innovation, the unexpected side effects such as rapid rising housing prices actually undermine the success of plan implementation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Who drives the formation and adoption of the “increasing versus decreasing balance policy"?—Evidence from a policy process analysis
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054648651&doi=10.1016%2fj.landusepol.2018.10.002&partnerID=40&md5=a101c0eca8ddfd423c31ff7a202fa54d
ABSTRACT: The “increasing versus decreasing balance policy (IDB)” is an important land use innovation in China and it transfers developmental rights from less productive rural land to more productive urban construction land. Since its initiation in 2000, it was soon adopted in almost all provinces in China. In the process of transferring developmental rights, what roles do different levels of governments play and why? To answer these questions, this research conducts a policy process analysis by combing the methods of process tracing and multi-level event history analysis. It finds that the policy process of IDB is a bottom-up one. The prefectural level governments are the engine of the whole process for they gain direct benefit from the transfer of developmental right. Provincial governments, on the one hand, act as a hub connecting local to central; on the other hand, fail to regulate and supervise the implementation. Central government is pushed by the force from local to enact the policy of IDB but also shows lukewarm support to it with a concern that it might deviate from the Pareto increase and damaged peasants’ wellbeing. This research explores the complicated inter-governmental relations in land policy-making process in China and also proposes policy implication on IDB's future implementation. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Livelihood mushroomed: Examining household level impacts of non-timber forest products (NTFPs) under new management regime in China's state forests
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85048555539&doi=10.1016%2fj.forpol.2018.06.001&partnerID=40&md5=262d6153b6728912bc391cfbbef5c989
ABSTRACT: Finding alternative livelihood possibility for state worker households is crucial for the successful implementation of Natural Forest Protection Program (NFPP) in China's key state forest regions. One local innovation to implement NFPP while allowing worker households alternative use of forestland is the “Contract Management Responsibility System (CMRS)”. Under CMRS, participating households have exclusive rights to harvest and grow non-timber forest products (NTFP) while fulfilling forest protection responsibility. Using two rounds of survey data, we evaluate the impact of CMRS on forest worker households’ livelihood and the sustainability of NTFPs. We also test and correct for the bias from attrition and self-selection simultaneously. We find that CMRS leads to a significant increase in household income from NTFPs’ production. We also find that increased NTFP species collected is associated with longer CMRS participation, which indicates improved sustainability. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Exploring the influence of common game elements on ideation output and motivation

ABSTRACT: Despite the widespread and increased usage of idea contests and, within these, gamification elements, scarce data exist on the effects of utilizing gamification elements to increase performance and motivation in idea contests. We therefore investigate the incentive effect of gamification elements on the output of online idea contests in a field experiment with 446 individuals across five treatment groups. Our results show that game elements can increase quantitative performance but not the motivation of participants or the quality of ideas. Additionally, we do not report a crowding-out effect. We therefore conclude that gamification is suited to improving the performance of effortless tasks, such as commenting, but it should not be the main driver behind improved idea quantity or quality levels. The results are in line with recent findings in the psychology literature suggesting that external incentives positively influence quantity but have less influence on the quality of performance. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

An exploration into the practice of online service failure and recovery strategies in the Balkans
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85052945220&doi=10.1016%2fj.jbusres.2018.08.035&partnerID=40&md5=680edf0cfdbbcf9c73777b9840a0b496
ABSTRACT: To help managers better balance online service failures and recovery strategies, organisations are increasingly offering a variety of recovery programmes. Anecdotal reports suggest that organisations are experimenting with various recovery strategies, and particularly transitioning offline recovery strategies into the emerging technological tapestries. Drawing on data collected from two Balkan countries (Kosovo and Albania) with varying service failures, recovery strategies and levels of participation in online environments, this study examines how interactions between the customer and provider impact on recovery strategies. Unlike existing studies regarding online service failure and recovery strategies, we argue that rather than examining the subconscious of the customer as a stand-alone explanation for failure-recovery perceptions, interactions with the provider must also be taken into account. The current study extends the related construct of failure-recovery perceptions and it suggests that service failure generates different recovery strategies based on the contextual social world. © 2018

ABSTRACT: In spring 2016, the Distributed Autonomous Organization (The DAO) was created on Ethereum. As with Bitcoin, Ethereum uses a P2P network, where distributed ledgers are implemented as daisy-chained blocks of data. Ethereum's native cryptocurrency, Ethers are spent to execute pieces of code called smart contracts. Investors paid their Ethers for the DAO to operate and received the opportunity to vote on and become investors in venture projects proposed by Ethereum-based startups. Transactions and settlements between investors and startups are executed autonomously. The DAO experiment failed shortly after inception as an anonymous hacker stole over $50M USD worth of Ethers out of the $168M invested. The Ethereum community voted to return (or fork) the state of the network to one prior to the hack, returning Ethers back to investors and shuttering the DAO. However, this action arguably represented as a bailout - ironically, Bitcoin was conceived as a reaction against the 2008 bailout of US banks - and violated the ledger immutability and "code is law" ethos of the blockchain community. © 2019, IGI Global.

Dialogical writing: Co-inquiring between the written and the spoken word

https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-84975230347&doi=10.1080%2f14759551.2016.1197923&partnerID=40&md5=a9b6ea48f55d070dd89b76057578f44d
ABSTRACT: The foundational view of discourse as a descriptive mode of representation and writing as a retrospective stabilizing tool has been criticized in organization and management research. The purpose of this paper is to inquire into a more emergent, unfinished, and relational writing used throughout the research processes. To that aim, I develop the notion of ‘dialogical writing’ by drawing on the literature on performative utterances and a collaborative fieldwork project where writing became an integrated part of the research process. I come to understand this form of writing as one in situ where addressivity, responsiveness, and unfinalizability are emphasized. This enables writing to be part of a conversation; writing as a response to that which has been said and in anticipation of the next possible utterance. I close with implications for writing in organization studies, such as the possibility of thinking of writing as an offering of the tentative. © 2016, © 2016 Informa UK Limited, trading as Taylor & Francis Group.

The dark side of feeling trusted for hospitality employees: An investigation in two service contexts
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047646642&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijhm.2018.04.001&partnerID=40&md5=5eb011f754d7ce998bc5426795a97b98
ABSTRACT: Emerging research appears to suggest that feeling trusted by management can facilitate employees’ organizational citizenship behavior (OCB). However, it is possible that feeling trusted can have negative effects on hospitality employees. In this paper, we draw on social exchange theory and self-determination theory to examine how feeling trusted can lead to potentially negative consequences for hospitality employees. We tested the hypotheses using data from two different studies. Study 1 used a time-lagged research design to collect a sample of 349 employee-supervisor dyads in a chain of six economy hotels. Study 2 was designed to generalize the results by examining a sample of 509 employees in healthcare hospitals. The results show that employees' feeling trusted has a direct effect on employee compulsory citizenship behavior (CCB). Furthermore, feeling trusted has an indirect effect on CCB mediated by employee organization based self-esteem (OBSE) and felt obligation, with the latter having a stronger effect. Our research contributes to the literature by examining the dark side of feeling trusted and the mechanism of how feeling trusted influences employee outcomes. © 2018

What determines forecasters’ forecasting errors?

https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054559928&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijforecast.2018.07.007&partnerID=40&md5=e8b839a45a053c5633b2c1da660df5eb
ABSTRACT: This paper contributes to the growing body of literature in macroeconomics and finance on expectation formation and information processing by analyzing the relationship between expectation formation at the individual level and the prediction of macroeconomic aggregates. Using information from business tendency surveys, we present a new approach of analyzing forecasters’ qualitative forecasting errors. Based on a quantal response approach with misclassification, we define forecasters’ qualitative mispredictions in terms of deviations from the qualitative rational expectation forecast, and relate them to the individual and macro factors that are driving these mispredictions. Our approach permits a detailed analysis of individual forecasting decisions, allowing for the introduction of individual and economy-wide determinants that affect the individual forecasting error process. © 2018 International Institute of Forecasters

An exploratory study of the standard reuse practice in a medium sized software development firm
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85049344535&doi=10.1016%2fj.csi.2018.06.005&partnerID=40&md5=55e2eb62e215149da070ab0087cbcca7
ABSTRACT: Reuse has been a topic of interest in software engineering since 1968. Although many academic papers have been written about adopting software reuse in companies, such a process in practice has proven difficult, long and costly to implement. At present, rigorous studies on the current practice of reuse in industry are scarce. Objective: The aim of this paper was to study the current practice of software reuse at a medium sized company, in particular, we aimed to alleviate the lack of data and identify barriers and success factors. Method: An exploratory study based upon descriptive surveys. Results: The predominant practice of reuse is ad hoc (73%) and the reusable artefacts were shared by means of a central repository (81%). Most practitioners use the Web to look for artefacts (92%), trying to understand them by studying code snippets or the artefact's documentation. The existence of a well-established reuse process (81%) and a high quality of the artefacts (70%) were the two most mentioned facilitators for reuse. Conclusions: All participants view software reuse as a beneficial process and believe that management should promote it. The results offer opportunities for further interpretation and comparison to software developers, project leaders, and researchers. However, these results cannot be generalized due to the specificity of the context we have studied. Replications of this study, in other business domains, are needed to generalize the results. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

Effects of learning on retailer ordering policy for imperfect quality items with trade credit financing
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85050917648&doi=10.5267%2fj.uscm.2018.5.003&partnerID=40&md5=e8823d3356bf82f9610a29b804feb9bd
ABSTRACT: Learning curves monitor the performance of workers for the given new task as well as it is a mathematical representation of the same learning process which can be analyzed after frequent repetitions. Now-a-days learning curve is a promotion effective tool for management concern with designing and controlling the process of imperfect production and redesigning unbalanced business operations in the production of goods or services related to scheduling, uncontrolled inventory management, quality management as well as inspection. Learning effect has direct impact in calculation of profit or loss. Generally, a business seller, in order to increase his sale prefers to lend his products to buyers for a definite period of time. There is no penalty before or during this definite time period however after the duration of lending time period is over, he will assign some extra charges. For this action, seller offers a trade credit financing period to his buyer. Assuming when buyer receives a lot he separates the defective and non-defective items by a screening process and defective items are then sold at a discounted price. The percentage of defective items decreases per lot according to learning curve. Seller too plans which condition is beneficial for good co-ordination of retailers and analysts. Different cases are explained broadly in this model to get maximum profit. In this paper, a fiscal construction feature model for imperfect quality items with trade credit policy is analyzed under the effects of learning. Total profit function per cycle has been derived with the help of involvement of different costs and related parameters for the retailers and a numerical example given ahead shows the verification of results. The impacts of key parameters of the model are studied by sensitivity analysts to deduce managerial insights. © 2019 by the authors; licensee Growing Science, Canada.

Factors influencing technological practices in the Brazilian agrarian reform

ABSTRACT: In recent decades, agriculture has responded to technology-related changes with strong productivity growth. Despite this evolution, the adoption of new technologies by small farmers has been a consistent challenge. In the coming years, the adoption of technology should be an essential element for the survival of small producers. To follow this evolution, the objective of this research is to identify factors that influence the adoption of higher levels of technological practices by producers of the agrarian reform in the Midwestern region of Brazil. Technological practices were evaluated based on the adoption of natural or chemical inputs, crop rotation, high yield seeds and mechanization. Higher levels of technological practices were defined as the joint use of these technologies, classified as technological packages. We identified two technological packages, one using natural inputs and the other chemical inputs. Questionnaires were applied to 1,162 settlers and the analytical model used was an ordered logit. Education, technical assistance and exchange experience with neighbors have a positive effect on technology use but do not favor the use of technological packages, which are instead favored by training courses in technology, partnerships with agro-food companies and resources available for investment. Thus, the government's priority should be to offer good technical support and access to training courses in technology. The financing of production costs did not show any effect on the adoption of technology, in contrast to funding for investments. Consequently, the financing of production costs should be reconsidered to favor greater technological investments. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Lithium and development imaginaries in Chile, Argentina and Bolivia
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054210424&doi=10.1016%2fj.worlddev.2018.09.019&partnerID=40&md5=130414193d31de9cdf0935fa4f842365
ABSTRACT: The world's largest deposits of lithium lie in brines found underneath salt flats in the desert between Chile, Argentina and Bolivia. Globally, lithium may reduce fossil fuel use by making batteries for cars and renewable energy storage more affordable. This article analyzes ongoing debates about lithium in these three countries to identify what hopes, fears and expectations different stakeholders are bringing to debates about lithium. My approach builds on the idea of resource imaginaries, particularly the concept of sociotechnical imaginaries that highlights the importance of science and technology to projections of desirable futures. I analyze the tensions, visions and metaphors used by different stakeholders, including activists, the media, and state and industry officials, to imagine and thus legitimate lithium extraction. This study finds three co-existing positions in these debates: lithium as a commodity, as a strategic resource or as the subject of a sociotechnical imaginary. Chile, Argentina and Bolivia are converging on the last of these, best described as a reimagining of the relationship between mining and development in which lithium, through innovation and industry, will redefine the relationship between Latin American economies and global markets. This imaginary projects a binary between raw and industrial materials and deterministically assumes that science and technology will transform the former into the latter. Disagreements and challenges notwithstanding, the article argues that this imaginary is evidence of a crisis of confidence in development that is creating space for a more dynamic debate about the social value of mining and the proper role of the state in development. This convergence will have also implications for how sustainable, equitable and reliable lithium production will be. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Enhancing employee engagement for small and medium enterprises in Taiwan
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055884516&doi=10.4018%2fIRMJ.2019010102&partnerID=40&md5=51919512bfc7f24bd783483254daa9b7
ABSTRACT: The aim of the research is to study the employee engagement strategies utilised in Taiwan's SMEs from the perspective of the employees. In doing so, a qualitative research method was employed using semi-structured interviews. Nine participants from five sectors of SMEs (electronics & information, metal transportation, machinery and equipment, food manufacturing, and textile) were interviewed. The authors' results reveal that having high levels of engagement amongst employees in Taiwan's SMEs will bring about an increase in work commitment amongst employees which encourages productivity for the organisation. These findings hold several important theoretical and practical implications. © 2019, IGI Global.

Associations between observed patterns of classroom interactions and teacher wellbeing in lower secondary school

https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055755966&doi=10.1016%2fj.tate.2018.10.013&partnerID=40&md5=78289e7188b04be43e7be5f85b2c17e9
ABSTRACT: Classroom observations and teacher self-reports were used to examine the relationships between patterns of teacher–student interactions and the wellbeing of Norwegian lower secondary school teachers. Latent profile analysis identified four subgroups. Teacher–student interactions and the teachers' wellbeing were inter-related in that teachers who were observed to be high in all the interaction domains (Emotional Support, Classroom Organization, and Instructional Support) perceived themselves as having high job satisfaction. The results showed that improving teachers’ wellbeing has the potential to improve teacher–student interactions and vice versa. The study also discusses the use of classroom observations to facilitate teacher–student interactions in teacher training. © 2018 The Authors

Learning from peers: The effect of sales history disclosure on peer-to-peer short-term rental purchases

ABSTRACT: The sharing economy has proliferated in recent years, yet continuous business efforts are required to cultivate trust between strangers. Drawing from observational learning theory and cultural perspective, our study examined sales history disclosure as a trust-building signal between hosts and travelers. Using large-scale online observational data of 33,327 listing purchase activities between 2012 and 2017 on a leading peer-to-peer short-term rental platform in China, we found strong evidence that sales history disclosure is positively associated with short-term rental purchases. Our results also revealed that sales history disclosure mitigates the positive impact of online reviews but weakens the negative effect of multi-listing ownership on subsequent purchases, further confirming information substitution theory. Our study provided theoretical and practical implications to strengthen the trust-building mechanism using coordinated signals, with cultural considerations, on short-term rental platforms. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Resilience of an inshore fishing population in Hong Kong: Paradox and potential for sustainable fishery policy
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055879870&doi=10.1016%2fj.marpol.2018.10.008&partnerID=40&md5=ec2713597c4c9601fbed2507928af3ce
ABSTRACT: The existence and dilemmas of metropolitan fisheries have been overlooked in research on the resilience of coastal marine socio-ecological systems. Yet, they could produce a model of sustainable fisheries with significant global impact. To fill that research gap, this study investigates an inshore fishery population that has sustained itself within Hong Kong's rapid urban development, seeking to understand the reasons for its survival. The results indicate that the values of self-reliance and entrepreneurialism exacted by fishing enabled the fishers to make necessary adaptations and reposition themselves in mariculture and service industries. These new ventures, while retaining marine-based livelihoods, draw the fishers away from fishing activities. The paradox of this value-based resilience of a metropolitan fishery is discussed for its potential to generate policies to strengthen linkages among the fishers’ business activities and to create a sustainable fishery model useful in other contexts. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Mapping the value chain of imported shellfish in China

https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055283512&doi=10.1016%2fj.marpol.2018.10.024&partnerID=40&md5=cdd4bb98906b17aa05edfcd29e6d8cee
ABSTRACT: This study explores the value chain structure and chain activities of the imported shellfish industry in China. Data were collected from face-to-face semi-structured interviews in Guangzhou (n = 30) and Shanghai (n = 23) and a face-to-face survey in Shanghai (n = 71). Data analysis employed both content and descriptive analyses. Results show that the value chain is composed of several important members including foreign exporters, Chinese importers, wholesalers, resellers and clearance companies. Business partnership is the main channel by which marketing information is gained by chain members. Relationships are quite stable among the chain members, with quality, price and credit items being the most important factors that influence chain relationships. It seems that imported shellfish from some developed countries (e.g. Canadian and U.S. lobsters) have reached a market saturation in China's first-tier cities (e.g. Guangzhou and Shanghai) and relevant chain members face fierce competition. E-commerce is still not mature enough as a tool for the marketing development of imported shellfish in China. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Predicting overall customer satisfaction: Big data evidence from hotel online textual reviews
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047010382&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijhm.2018.03.017&partnerID=40&md5=ba15f7bb48714bbd52f92b2ec2383ff8
ABSTRACT: Customer online reviews of hotels have significant business value in the e-commerce and big data era. Online textual reviews have an open-structured form, and the technical side, namely the linguistic attributes of online textual reviews, is still largely under-explored. Using a sample of 127,629 reviews from tripadvisor.com, this study predicts overall customer satisfaction using the technical attributes of online textual reviews and customers’ involvement in the review community. We find that a higher level of subjectivity and readability and a longer length of textual review lead to lower overall customer satisfaction, and a higher level of diversity and sentiment polarity of textual review leads to higher overall customer satisfaction. We also find that customers’ review involvement positively influences their overall satisfaction. We provide implications for hoteliers to better understand customer online review behavior and implement efficient online review management actions to use electronic word of mouth and enhance hotels’ performance. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

An empirical study of the role of knowledge characteristics and tools on knowledge transfer in China-based multinationals
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054330241&doi=10.4018%2fJGIM.2019010109&partnerID=40&md5=87df784747296ae3ef36e52127b7cc7b
ABSTRACT: This article describes how technology-i.e. the infrastructure of tools, systems, platforms-enhances knowledge transfer. The effect of tools on the relationship between knowledge characteristics and knowledge transfer effectiveness is under-researched. This article attempts to address the interplay of knowledge characteristics and transfer tools within multinational corporations (MNCs). Based on the structural equation modelling, this research proposes and tests a basic model that captures knowledge characteristics and transfer tools at 125 Japanese subsidiaries operating in China. Drawing on the literature, this article argues that the role of knowledge characteristics and transfer tools need to be considered for effective knowledge transfer between MNCs and their subsidiaries. Knowledge characteristics and transfer tools play differing roles in knowledge transfer. This article also extends the existing studies by focusing on knowledge characteristics and transfer tool constructs simultaneously in a model to understand the notion of knowledge transfer effectiveness in the global business context.

Identifying consistent patterns of quality learning discussions in blended learning
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054320425&doi=10.1016%2fj.iheduc.2018.09.002&partnerID=40&md5=d1249f71cd7b2d9a40a85941ee304a4d
ABSTRACT: Adopting relational perspectives on university student learning, this research identified patterns of varying quality of learning through blended discussions. It investigated associations amongst conceptions of learning through discussions, approaches to face-to-face and online discussions, and academic achievement amongst two cohorts of postgraduates (N = 387 and N = 184) in the same business course over two consecutive years in an Australian university. Inclusion of two studies allowed an examination of the extent to which the relationships amongst variables were consistent and stable. The two studies showed logical and stable relationship amongst key variables: cohesive conceptions of learning through discussions were positively linked with deep approaches that students adopted towards discussions in class and online, which also related positively to better academic achievement. Our results suggest that university instructors should help learners see values of learning through blended discussions and explicate how the face-to-face and online discussions are integrated. © 2018

Influence of brand signature, brand awareness, brand attitude, brand reputation on hotel industry's brand performance
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85047741535&doi=10.1016%2fj.ijhm.2018.05.016&partnerID=40&md5=1344ccc03ab6f68b86702f5f6473e317
ABSTRACT: This paper develops a multi-disciplinary measure of the brand signature construct by means of literature review and primary data analysis. This study explains that brand signature involves (i) endorsement of consistent consumer attitude toward diffusion of a brand name and brand logo (consists of typeface, design, and color); (ii) the expression and pursuit of a distinct message and the quality of the organization to consumers as well as consistency in communication; and (iii) the implementation, support, and maintenance of hotel brand signature systems based on the use of online/offline media. SEM is employed in order to test the proposed model. The results indicate that brand signature includes dissemination of its dimensions; brand attitude with two components (brand association and brand belief); brand awareness consists of brand familiarity, and brand recognisability; and consistency in brand reputation and prefaced by hotel brand performance implementation. Brand signature is recommended as a tool useful for the service industry to manage their global hotel brand reputation and performance. © 2018

The role of governance modes and meta-governance in the transformation towards sustainable water governance
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055666599&doi=10.1016%2fj.envsci.2018.10.008&partnerID=40&md5=5d0a2f7d174dbe23e7a8d5d25b2450a4
ABSTRACT: For several decades, water policy reform and the design of governance systems were dominated by simplistic panaceas. This was accompanied by changing preferences for specific types of policy instruments and modes of steering. Such dominance has given way to a more nuanced understanding of requirements for sustainable and integrated water governance capable of addressing the challenges of global and climate change. This paper focusses on the role of governance modes and on meta-governance. Governance mode refers to a certain logic and form through which governance can be realized. The paper uses the distinction between bureaucratic hierarchies, networks and markets to denote different modes of governance. It argues that hybrid governance systems with synergistic interplay between these different governance modes are essential for dealing with complex water management challenges. Furthermore, it argues that the development of such governance systems requires a combination of purposeful design and self-organization. An exploratory comparative analysis of water governance in Germany, the Netherlands, Australia, China and South Africa illustrates the validity and relevance of the conceptual considerations. The paper concludes by highlighting the need for meta-governance as a reflexive process of societal learning to develop, evaluate and adapt governance approaches with the purpose of addressing complex societal challenge. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Mediating factors that influence the technology integration practices of teacher educators
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054597440&doi=10.1016%2fj.compedu.2018.09.023&partnerID=40&md5=c1d92097ca6b59b69157ff45cee9a92e
ABSTRACT: While the United States federal government and the main teacher education accreditation organization push for the inclusion of technology in teacher education across the curriculum, little attention has been paid to understanding the technology competencies and behaviors of teacher educators. This study explores this gap by investigating what direct and mediating factors predict technological pedagogical content knowledge (TPACK) in teacher educators, and how these factors along with TPACK influence the adoption of the ISTE technology standards in teacher education. The findings from a sample of 806 teacher educators across the United States indicate that there are significant differences in both TPACK and ISTE standard alignment across subject areas, and that experience levels positively predict ISTE standard alignment to a small degree. More significant, however, is the finding that technology knowledge and institutional support are important mediators, predicting TPACK and ISTE standard alignment. Additionally, TPACK strongly predicts ISTE standard alignment. These findings suggest that institutions should provide targeted support to teacher educators across disciplines and should adopt coherent technology frameworks for their programs. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Hierarchical network systems: An application to high-technology industry in China

https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85039545498&doi=10.1016%2fj.omega.2017.12.007&partnerID=40&md5=a7f7dae87d90cf096b40039215693349
ABSTRACT: In real world situations, there is a hierarchical structure exists in a specific organization and each component has its network process. However, such hierarchical network system has not been well studied in previous literature, and misleading results often are produced. The current paper discusses a data envelopment analysis (DEA) modelling technique for a network structure where a hierarchical system consists of components having two-stage series processes. An additive network DEA is proposed to evaluate the performance of this type of network structure. The overall and divisional efficiencies of the system and each component can be derived, and the relationship between system efficiency, divisional efficiency and the ones of components is discussed. The newly developed additive network DEA is nonlinear and cannot be converted into a linear program. A semidefinite programming (SDP) approach is developed for effectively solving this model and the global solution can be guaranteed. Another linear multiplicative network DEA also developed for this hierarchical system. The two newly developed models are illustrated with a case of the performance evaluation of high-technology industry in China. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

Optimised buffer allocation to construct stable personnel shift rosters
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85039550738&doi=10.1016%2fj.omega.2017.12.006&partnerID=40&md5=472c3046ed6be9a5c980ffe997873994
ABSTRACT: Organisations need to construct stable baseline personnel shift rosters based on forecasts about the future personnel demand and employee availability. However, variability arises in the short-term, which renders these forecasts incorrect and affects the quality of the personnel roster. In this paper, we study how to anticipate this variability by introducing capacity buffers in the personnel shift roster. We propose a new approach by solving an equivalent deterministic formulation of a stochastic personnel shift scheduling problem. In contrast to traditional approaches, the size and position of capacity buffers are not defined in advance but are adequately determined as an endogenous variable by the proposed optimisation model to align the available personnel capacity to the stochastic demand. We propose different strategies to define the anticipated uncertainty and to allocate capacity buffers accordingly. We validate the performance of these strategies through a comparison with a deterministic minimum cost strategy and a more traditional resource buffer strategy based on a three-step methodology. This methodology makes use of simulation and optimisation to mimic the hierarchical personnel planning process. © 2017 Elsevier Ltd

Optimal trade-in strategy of business-to-consumer platform with dual-format retailing model
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85040631417&doi=10.1016%2fj.omega.2018.01.004&partnerID=40&md5=2c9a75bdd74f228a43398e15f2336d03
ABSTRACT: B2C platforms are increasingly implementing trade-in programs to boost sales. Most of these platforms have adopted dual-format retailing model including both self-run stores and third-party stores. Under trade-in program framework, B2C platforms will determine the optimal trade-in rebate, and whether to offer the rebate to consumers with gift card (GC) or cash coupon (CC). GC can only be used in self-run stores, while CC can be used in both stores. To entice more consumers to trade-in products, platforms may launch trade-in efforts in the market. To address such decision-making challenges, we consider a B2C platform who owns a self-run store and hosts a third-party store, and examine the optimal trade-in strategy for the platform by developing four theoretical models. We first present two models without considering trade-in efforts, i.e., one model regarding GC payment, and one model regarding CC payment, and then extend them by taking trade-in efforts into consideration. Some interesting findings and insights are achieved. In particular, we find that both GC and CC do not always benefit the platform. Interestingly, offering high quality and low selling price for products in both the self-run store and the third-party store are also not always beneficial to the platform. So is the competition between both stores. Launching trade-in efforts may lead to a lower trade-in rebate but a higher profit for the platform. A counterintuitive finding is obtained that a higher gift card redemption rate is not beneficial to the platform, and vice versa. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

CONCRETop - A multi-criteria decision method for concrete optimization
. 
https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85055874642&doi=10.1016%2fj.eiar.2018.10.006&partnerID=40&md5=7e9b886563f6db6de816d944a47d3b40
ABSTRACT: CONCRETop is a novel multi-criteria decision method developed by the authors of this study for concrete optimization, which can be used to optimize either conventional or non-conventional concrete mixes. It can be used to identify the main differences between concrete mixes in terms of three perspectives, namely quality performance, environmental impacts and cost efficiency, and the corresponding causes. The characteristics of concrete fundamentally depend on its target application (e.g. the structural design project). In other words, it depends on the requested characteristics demanded by the consumer. However, this method allows optimizing concrete mixes based on the three mentioned perspectives even if the specific characteristics of concrete for the selected application are unknown. For complicated cases like this one, five scenarios (business as usual, green, strength, service life, and cost) were proposed with different threshold values, in order to cover most of the construction cases (the majority of concrete applications). The major outcome of this method is to provide researchers with a validated approach to support the development of non-conventional materials with optimized technical performance and minimum cost, environmental impact and natural resources’ consumption. The method is valid for any case studies and concrete mixes worldwide. Most importantly, this optimization process may change how we take care of the next generation and find sustainable alternative materials for the concrete industry. © 2018 Elsevier Inc.

ABSTRACT: Instructors in STEM classrooms often frame students’ interactions with technologies to help them learn content. For instance, in many STEM domains, instructors commonly help students translate physical 3D models into 2D drawings by prompting them to focus on (a) orienting physical 3D models and (b) generating 2D drawings. We investigate whether framing prompts that target either of these practices enhance the effectiveness of an educational technology that supports collaborative translation among multiple representations. To this end, we conducted a quasi-experiment with 565 undergraduate chemistry students. All students collaboratively built physical 3D models of molecules and translated them into 2D drawings. In a business-as-usual control condition, students drew on paper, without support from an educational technology. In two experimental conditions, students drew in an educational technology that provided feedback and prompted collaboration. One condition received framing prompts to focus on physical models (model condition); another received prompts to generate intermediary drawings on paper (draw condition). Compared to the control condition, the model condition showed higher learning gains, but the draw condition showed lower learning gains. Analyses of log data showed that students made more model-based errors, and the prompts in the model condition reduced these model-based errors. However, interviews with instructors showed that they prefer drawing-focused prompts, in contrast to our results. These findings offer theoretical insights into how students learn to translate among representations. Furthermore, they yield practical recommendations for the use of educational technologies that support learning with multiple representations. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

ABSTRACT: Research literature suggests that online trust and commitment are the core constructs in building a sustainable electronic commerce relationship. This article investigates the respective roles of the platform, supplier and medium in forming online trust, and determines whether these factors ultimately influence purchase intentions. It seeks to re-examine the trust model by McKnight and identifies how a trust model can be adapted in current business environments. A model is developed and tested by six constructs which have an impact on each other. Survey data from online platform customers (n = 386) are used to test the online trust hypotheses with structural equation modeling. As hypothesized, the results suggest that platform, supplier and medium have a positive relationship with online trust, and especially the platform has the highest positive impact. Among platform sub constructs, the web design, supplier rank and the privacy policy are crucial. After sale service, the company location and price strongly influence the supplier. For the medium sub constructs, 3rd party seals impact the medium more strongly than expert comments and consumer reviews. However, the medium has negative impact on behavioral intentions. The article identifies interesting differences between the original work by McKnight and the findings of this study, but basically concludes that the online trust theory applies to current electronic commerce market. Few studies have examined the role of platform, supplier and medium separately in forming online trust. This study divides platform and supplier into two separate constructs to meet the new market development. The modified model truly reflects the vibrant online platform environment and can provide better insight into managing the platform. © 2019, IGI Global.

ABSTRACT: The so-called fourth industrial revolution features the application of modern Information & Communication Technology (ICT) concepts and technologies in industrial contexts to create more flexible and innovative products and services leading to new business models and added value. The emerging Industrial Internet of Things (IIoT) is one of the main results of this revolution. One of the most known and adopted communication protocol in the context of the fourth industrial revolution is OPC UA (IEC 62541). Although this standard already combines features coming from both industrial and ICT contexts, current literature presents several approaches aimed to introduce ICT enhancements into OPC UA in order to further improve its usability in industrial environments. Some of these approaches are based on the proposal to make OPC UA RESTful, due to many advantages of RESTful services in industrial settings. OPC UA is based on a client/server architecture and adopts an information model at the server side, whose access from the client side requires knowledge of a data model, whose structure is sometimes complex, creating some difficulties for a resource-constrained device acting as client. The paper proposes the definition of a web platform able to offer access to OPC UA servers through a REST architecture. The approach presented in the paper differs from other existing solutions, mainly because it allows to realise a lightweight OPC UA RESTful interface reducing the complexity of the basic knowledge to be held by a generic user of the platform. For this reason, the solution presented allows enhancement of OPC UA interoperability towards resource-constrained devices. The web platform has been implemented and the relevant code is available on GitHub. © 2018 Elsevier B.V.

The influence of instructional design on learner control, sense of achievement, and perceived effectiveness in a supersize MOOC course

https://www.scopus.com/inward/record.uri?eid=2-s2.0-85054801151&doi=10.1016%2fj.compedu.2018.10.001&partnerID=40&md5=f40896ad3d71e0cf8927b53a4d8d10f1
ABSTRACT: Responding to the lack of empirical studies on the effects of instructional design components on MOOCs, this study explores which instructional design components (e.g., course content, transactional interaction between student and content, structure/organization, assessment) influence learner control, sense of progress in the achievement of learning goals (sense of progress), and perceived effectiveness in a large-scale MOOC course called “Learning How to Learn” hosted in Coursera, a MOOC learning platform. Using an online survey distributed to learners who registered for the current Coursera English-language version of the course, we collected 1364 responses. Three separate hierarchical regression analyses revealed that all course design factors, transactional interaction between student and content (β=.111,p<0.01; β=.117,p<.01), structure (β=.432,p<0.001; β=.281,p<.001), and assessment (β=.108,p<0.01; β=.102,p<.05) were significant predictors of learner control and sense of progress. For perceived effectiveness, only transactional interaction (β=.073,p<0.05) and structure (β=.416,p<0.001) were significant while assessment was not statistically significant (β=.030,p=.373). These findings provided empirical evidence that instructional components are critical predictors of student learning in MOOCs, which have been conceptualized as important factors in prior studies. Future research should focus on identifying effective and efficient ways to facilitate assessments as part of the learning process while accommodating personalized learning needs. Interpretations of the findings, discussions, and limitations are also addressed in this paper. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Resilience and social capital: The engagement of fisheries communities in marine spatial planning

ABSTRACT: Between 2010 and 2016, the Orkney Islands Council, Highland Council and Marine Scotland have collaborated to develop a pilot Marine Spatial Plan for the Pentland Firth and Orkney Waters in Scotland. This paper explores the challenges of marine spatial planning processes by looking at the possibilities for fisheries communities to mobilize their social capital – in the form of bonding, bridging or linking – in order to re-position and to empower themselves in these processes. This paper aims to uncover the resilience of local communities that deploy social capital in order to influence MSP processes and safeguard their own interests. For this article ten weeks of qualitative fieldwork in the form of in-depth interviews and participant observation with stakeholders of the pilot marine spatial plan were conducted on the Orkney Islands in Scotland. The strong bonding social capital among fishermen in Orkney has resulted in a resilient community identity which allows for collaboration and self-organization, but also creates a defensive mentality which does not favor linking. Furthermore, a lack of trust in governmental authorities inhibits the mobilization of linking social capital among fishermen, obstructing the ability to access power through cross-scale connections. In response the fisheries community uses bridging social capital outside governance arenas to access networks and mobilize resources to strengthen its socio-economic and political position in support of future linking social capital. Researching this complex interrelation and functioning of social capital uncovers some of the social dimensions and socio-institutional constraints for fisheries engagement with and power in marine spatial planning. © 2018 Elsevier Ltd

Intensifying Forest Management in China: What does it mean, why, and how?

ABSTRACT: Driven by increased space demand for urbanization and conservation as well as demand for food and bioenergy, competition for forestland in China has intensified. Meanwhile, the forestland in China has been poorly managed, leading to low stand quality, growth rate, and ecosystem functionality. Thus, an overarching question has been how to manage the country's forestland more efficiently. The objective of this paper is to address this question by assessing China's forestry development strategy, policy, and practice against the potential of its forests and the goal of its society. Our analysis suggests that a crucial pathway is to implement a classified management strategy, whereby a small portion of suitable forestland is dedicated to intensive plantations for producing timber and fiber, while a selective but large part of the other commercial forests will be more effectively managed to provide ecosystem services as well as to produce timber. Increases in growth and yield from these forests will result in positive feedbacks such that a larger amount of remaining forestland can be devoted to other non-timber uses to achieve sustainability nationally. In addition, a substantial portion of forestland has been and will be further set aside as nature reserves, wildlife habitats, and forest parks, etc. To implement this strategy successfully, China must make transform its forestry organizational and governance systems. © 2017 Elsevier B.V.

ABSTRACT: The article approaches the symbolic effectiveness of the Tupinambá sound system as agency, in the sense of objectification of intentions, which promote effects on the relations shared by people professionally connected to the sound system. The concept of symbolic effectiveness is defined here as a practice of coordinating emotions in search of an effect, even though related specifically to a festive and recreative context. Sound systems are family enterprises that play music professionally in dancing parties in Belém and in its surroundings. The research reveals, in Tupinambá's foundational history, the existence of ties between procedures from urban show business and meanings related to social domains attached to ritual and religion. The performative symbolic effectiveness of the sound system is associated to the magic and religious devotion ofits founders, dedicated to the Indian-yokel José Tupinambá. This is an enchanted entity from Mina Nagô, native religion to the Brazilian state of Pará. The fieldwork covered Tupinambá's appearances in dancing parties and collected interviews with the enterprise's owners and workers. © 2018 Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Ciencias Sociais - ANPOCS.
L'article aborde l'efficacité symbolique du système de son Tupinambá comme agence, au sens de l'objectivation des intentions, qui favorisent des effets sur les relations partagées par des personnes liées professionnellement au système sonore. La notion d'efficacité symbolique est définie ici comme une pratique d'ordination des émotions à la recherche d'un effet, liée ici spécifiquement à un contexte festif et récréatif. Systèmes sonores sont des entreprises familiales qui jouent la musique professionnellement dans des soirées dansantes à Belém et à ses environs. La recherche révèle, dans l'histoire fondatrice de Tupinambá, l'existence de liens entre les procédures de l'industrie du spectacle urbain et les significations liées aux domaines sociaux attachés au rituel et religion. L'efficacité symbolique et performative du système de son est associé à la dévotion religieuse de ses fondateurs dédié à l'indien-paysanJosé Tupinambá. Ceci est une entité enchantée de la Mina Nagô du Pará, religion d'originedans ce départment brésilien.

O artigo discute a eficácia simbólica da aparelhagem Tupinambá como agência, isto é, como objetificação de intenções, promotora de efeitos nas relações entre as pessoas profissionalmente vinculadas ao sistema sonoro. A noção de eficácia simbólica é tratada aqui como prática de ordenamento de emoções em busca de um efeito, mas relacionada especificamente com um contexto lúdico-festivo. Aparelhagens são empresas familiares de sonorização de festas dançantes típicas de Belém e região metropolitana. A pesquisa revela, na história de formação do Auto Som Tupinambá, a existência de vínculos entre práticas do mercado urbano de entretenimento e sentidos próprios a domínios sociais ligados ao ritual e à religião. A eficácia simbólica da aparelhagem, performática, se associa à identificação mágico-religiosa dos fundadores do empreendimento com a proteção do índio caboclo José Tupinambá, encantado da mina nagô paraense. A pesquisa de campo percorreu apresentações do Tupinambá em eventos festivos e produziu entrevistas com proprietários e trabalhadores da aparelhagem. © 2018 Associacao Nacional de Pos-Graduacao e Pesquisa em Ciencias Sociais - ANPOCS.
